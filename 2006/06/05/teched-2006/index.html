<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I&#8217;m very, very excited to be going to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2006/default.mspx">Microsoft&#8217;s TechEd</a> conference this year with my boss.  Now I&#8217;m counting down the days - we leave for Boston on June 10, and the conference runs from June 11 - 16.  The first conference I was able to talk my way into going to was VBITS 2000, and as I think back upon my years training and consulting for my previous employer, that was among the best. <br /><br />I got to rub shoulders with some pretty amazing people, and learned many valuable lessons.  I&#8217;ll never forget sheepishly asking <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/aaron/">Aaron Skonnard</a> what he thought of XML Data Islands in IE 5, or <a href="http://betav.com/BLOG/billva/">Bill Vaughn&#8217;s</a> theatrics (and knowledge) of data access.<br /><br />I think my approach and goals at the conference may be a little different from some people who are looking forward to a week off to fraternize and network.  I&#8217;m hoping to learn as much as possible since I&#8217;m not sure when next I&#8217;ll get the opportunity to go to a conference on my employer&#8217;s expense.<br /><br />The biggest trick is going to be separating the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html">Fire & Motion</a> from the sessions that will give me knowledge and direction for the work I do on a daily basis.  Of course it&#8217;s good to be aware of what&#8217;s upcoming, but I&#8217;ve always been really reluctant to spend much of an investment in something that is subject to change.  Beyond that I usually prefer to wait when adopting something for a little while (let others be the bug testers) so that also pits me against things that are a bit too futuristic.<br /><br />With that said, <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/te06/DavidTechEd.pdf">here is my schedule</a> for the week.  There are a few things I&#8217;d like to see this year (list is totally subject to change, like, on a minute by minute basis):<br /><br />1. More ASP.NET 2.0<br />Deeper on the new features, Personalization API, Web Parts, Internals<br /><br />2. XML / XQuery / LINQ<br />Some ideas on where these are in the pipeline so I can start using them on projects<br /><br />3. Workflow<br />I have DVDs of the last TechEd, and this came up a bit. I&#8217;m interested again on seeing an angle to take on this tool.<br /><br />4. Sharepoint and Biztalk<br />I signed up for a few sessions but this is the part where I get leary; I&#8217;m not sure when the 2007 versions will be out and about.  I know there are many, many opportunities to use the current versions of these products and would probably benefit from seeing that kind of stuff right away.  But I&#8217;m hoping to glean and perhaps get a few tidbits to stay ahead of the curve when the new versions are released.<br /><br />5. Team System<br />We are using it in house, so I need to understand it - I also want to get an accurate picture of how Team System can be leveraged by small teams.  Most descriptions (and the pricing!) seems to put it in the &#8220;enterprise&#8221; category but most of what I&#8217;ve worked on in the past, and probably for the forseeable future will be software projects with less than 20 people involved. <br /><br />6. IIS 7<br />I use IIS every day, and it&#8217;s been like an old friend since the early versions. I&#8217;d like to see where the product is headed, and how its path meets with ASP.NET 2.0 and all the other pieces of web application development.<br /><br />7. Architecture Talks<br />I signed up for a few that will hopefully be interesting and useful.  I&#8217;d also like to get a better handle on SOA, &#8220;contracts,&#8221; and the like.  Distributed architecture makes a lot of sense to me, but I&#8217;m a bit wary of the architecture astronauts when it comes to enterprise application architectures - I try to translate that stuff into what I do on a daily basis (enterprise app for a publicly traded company of 5000+ employees) and still sometimes miss the mark.  Perhaps I&#8217;ll get a chance to meet some people in this environment as well who I can maintain contact with.<br /><br />I&#8217;m hoping that I&#8217;ll be able to change sessions as well during the conference. I&#8217;m fairly pleased with what I have, but the flexibility would be nice.<br /><br />As the week progresses I&#8217;ll hopefully write down some things I&#8217;ll be hoping to answer, as well as some pre-conference reading. <br /><br />TechEd 2006, here I come!<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
