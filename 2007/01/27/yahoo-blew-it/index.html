<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />Just finished a Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/wiredmag/0,72497-0.html">piece</a> by Fred Vogelstein on how Yahoo fell behind Google. There&#8217;s more detail in the tell but in a nutshell it boils down to a comment Joel Spolsky had made on his Venture Voice podcast: non-technical managers and CEOs are the doom of technology companies.  Or, in the closing paragraph of Vogelstein&#8217;s article:<br /><blockquote>&#8220;At Yahoo, the marketers rule, and at Google the engineers rule. And for that,<br />Yahoo is finally paying the price.&#8221;</blockquote><br />It&#8217;s a good morality tale and definitely one I see as true in the world around me.  Especially as many non-technical people launch &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; companies, I wonder how often it will be replayed for those of us with a different, more technical perspective.<br /><br />But I&#8217;m not convinced that Yahoo is out for the count.  There are a few things that I think they get right and with a change in approach can really capitalize on:<br /><br />1. Mail - Yahoo makes my favorite web based mail client. I use the &#8220;beta&#8221; version of their mail software which was written by the folks from <a href="http://www.oddpost.com/">Oddpost</a>. I wonder if they&#8217;d turn these guys loose to write some other cool software, like a killer RSS Reader to make Netvibes eat its heart out.<br /><br />2. Curators - The craze at the moment is over user generated content but a model that I think will still remain profitable is that of having curated content; hiring someone who knows what they are doing to pick out what&#8217;s interesting for others in a particular domain. Why can&#8217;t Yahoo take what is done so well on <a href="http://picks.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Picks</a> and extend that to more specific content? Not overblown CNN style content heaviness, just a small group of people that find a few interesting things and keep the site sparse.  What&#8217;s ironic is that as &#8220;user generated&#8221; content seems to overtake the web, there is more need for people who can pre-parse it to find what&#8217;s more special.<br /><br />3. Developer APIs - One thing that made me happy about <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com">Yahoo&#8217;s Developer Network</a> was that it had to do with pushing out their philosophy and sharing what they standardize well. Their APIs are a bit bulky in my opinion at present, but there are some <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">clever</a> <a href="http://nate.koechley.com/blog/">people</a> over there who can really help developers be more productive.<br /><br />4. Excellent content - <a href="http://movies.yahoo.com">Yahoo Movies</a>, <a href="http://tv.yahoo.com">Yahoo TV</a> to name a few.  I keep going back because they are that useful.<br /><br />There are more things but I&#8217;m an outsider who is simply commenting on what he likes.  Yahoo has a lot of smart technical people they don&#8217;t seem to be listening to.  Reading <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/006524.html">Jeremy Zawodny</a> and <a href="http://www.joshwoodward.com/d/1570.html">Josh Woodward</a> shortly after the release of Google Finance seemed to confirm this sad fact.<br /><br />Because the one thing about the Wired post that bothered me was that Vogelstein kept going back to the leadership of Yahoo under Terry Semel where I see as big of a problem in Yahoo not being able to leverage its developers for ideas beyond how to implement specifications.  Semel&#8217;s ability to make deals and encourage integration are a part of this, but it seems like it occured at multiple levels of management, not just at the top.<br /><br />One more thing I can think of helping Yahoo stay relevent in their battle against Google and other web companies: why not buy some of Paul Graham&#8217;s companies (or other &#8220;built to sell&#8221; companies that seem like winners)?  Forget revenue models, forget integrations - forget all that MBA stuff for a moment.  <a href="http://www.thinkature.com">Thinkature </a>(<em>Yahoo anounces Visio modeling mixed with Powerpoint presentability for the future</em>), <a href="http://www.snipshot.com">Snipshot </a>(<em>Yahoo delivers online photo editing and hosting for the masses</em>), <a href="http://www.jamglue.com/">Jamglue </a>(<em>Yahoo presents technology to mix/remix and make ring</em>tones)&#8230;  there are a lot more than these to be sure, but just of the top of my head -  represent some ideas that can get people excited.  Not only that, the young founders are the types of people who won&#8217;t stop thinking even after their technology enters a bigger and perhaps more orthodox arena.  Money doesn&#8217;t grow on trees but Yahoo has a lot of resources and a big market capitalization to work with - it only takes <a href="http://www.youtube.com">one good idea</a> to make the whole thing worth it.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t think Yahoo is done by any means. I sincerely hope they have a second life, not necessarily as a victor in a war against Google, but more as a successful web company staying relevant and making people happy.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

Hey, landed on your blog, nice stuff. I found a cool new tool for our blogs&#8230; <A HREF="http://www.widgetmate.com/" REL="nofollow">www.widgetmate.com</A> It helps get latest news for our keywords directly on to our blog. I added it on mine. Worked like a charm.</div>

Good post.  I also like to theorize why the big boys (and others) are &#8220;successfull&#8221;.</div>
