<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>Once or twice people have confused what I&#8217;m doing with sales. Some time back I met with a prospective client and kept having to explain that I actually do write code and would probably be a lead developer on any work they gave us. The reaction I had for even the mere perception that I was &#8220;sales&#8221; was a little surprising to myself although with some reflection I realized it was because I conflated most of what I disliked about salesmen into an image I couldn&#8217;t deal with for myself: </p> <ul> <li>Style over substance</li> <li>Shallow understanding</li> <li>Pandering for a quick buck</li></ul> <p>But once in my life I was a happy salesman. Some time back I pushed the company I worked for into adopting FogBugz and really building a large part of our lifecycle around it. I did so enthusiastically after reading Joel&#8217;s early essays on bug tracking and seeing how well it applied to our situation.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve seen other bug tracking software since but still think the FogBugz experience was best.&nbsp; It seems simple, but because of how much thought has gone into the product, I gather a lot of work has gone into keeping it stripped from unnecessary features.</p> <p>To be clear, I don&#8217;t work as a bona fide &#8220;in house&#8221; developer. But as a consulting company, I spend a lot of time playing that role or working with people in it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s therefore conflicting when I read his understanding of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/04.html">what it means</a> to work in house. Phil Haack had it right in the middle of 2005 when he <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2005/07/26/9027.aspx">wrote</a> of the irony of this disdain towards the people that would be excited to use his software in the first place.</p> <p>I wonder what kind of conditioning it is - maybe that I&#8217;ve liked musical artists who are fairly open about loathing their fanbase - but I still miss the simplicity and elegance of FogBugz.&nbsp; </p> <p>What&#8217;s sad these days is that as much as I&#8217;d like to slip on the poorly fitting suit and do my sales routine, we get Sharepoint for free (okay, not free but let&#8217;s just say Microsoft does an excellent job making it seem so) and it&#8217;s the environment in which we track what I&#8217;d gotten my previous company to use FogBugz for so effectively.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not a big Sharepoint fan (that&#8217;s an understatement) so I&#8217;d even be tempted to go The Powers That Be and ask for FogBugz if I couldn&#8217;t predict the answer right away.</p> <p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be unflustered but I&#8217;ve got a few comments on what it&#8217;s like to be in house: </p> <p>1. In a small enough company, <strong>it&#8217;s great to have decision making power</strong>.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve used technologies like Ajax and Perl where a larger environment would have involved committee meetings with some manager shooting me down for doing things differently. You don&#8217;t have to be a renegade to do this, just document what you do well and communicate with anyone you&#8217;re working with that may have to look at it on your behalf.</p> <p>2. In consulting it helps a lot to <strong>condition your client</strong>.&nbsp; First build confidence with a track record of success, after which the client is usually willing to listen to you when you&#8217;d like to do things &#8220;right&#8221; or improve a piece of software even if it&#8217;s getting by functionally.&nbsp; After a while, depending on the client, they will usually just trust your judgement and stay away from technical arguments unless there&#8217;s some disproportionate cost.</p> <p>3. <strong>Software is never finished</strong>.&nbsp; This is true even for what is developed in house.&nbsp; As a result the process of continual improvement still exists.&nbsp; It takes a tremendous amount of discipline to try to develop things right when there&#8217;s a small budget or a tight deadline but I always think of those moments I&#8217;ve spent late at night hacking the ugliest workarounds because of a bad initial effort. Most of the time finishing when it&#8217;s &#8220;good enough&#8221; is about the taste and craftsmanship of the person who writes the software; whether they tried to think of the future or not.</p> <p>4. From working in both a &#8220;software company&#8221; and a &#8220;consulting company&#8221; I understand that <strong>software development is always a process of coming to terms with friction</strong> - all the unexpected realities and circumstances of real life and real users. Different places will have different kinds of friction; where an in house developer may have to deal with the kind of discipline it takes to write unit tests on a deadline a programmer at a software company may have the dilemma of trying to be all things to all people. </p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
