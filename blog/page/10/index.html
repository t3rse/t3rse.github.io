<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>Kevin Dangoor recorded an interesting screencast on some of the essentials of getting an open source project more widely circulated. Essentially Dangoor explains that having a successful open source project is not just about code, it&#8217;s about good product management. I wanted to title this post with Dangoor&#8217;s most quotable quote: &quot;Rails is not where it is because of great code.&quot; But there are a lot of people who would take that as an opener for a religious war without seeing his real intent of highlighting marketing and management of a project.</p>  <p>I won&#8217;t rehash it, it&#8217;s worth <a href="http://dangoor.blip.tv/file/1530233/">watching it</a> for yourself.</p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>It&#8217;s been alluded to but here it is neither shaken nor stirred: I became a father exactly on month ago.&#160; While it hasn&#8217;t been without challenges the joy of being a father is something I understand now firsthand after being told or observing it in others. Even though I first was quite seduced by a &quot;mystique&quot; in programming - a nocturnal person drinking jolt with binary being reflected from mirror shades - I now realize not only that nearly every programmer and professional person I admire is a parent, but that they find their core of happiness in that well beyond the realm of work.</p>  <p>Nevertheless, I have been trying to keep up my personal work and interests so with that goal in mind I&#8217;ve adjusted my schedule to wake up as early as I can (usually 5am) and get a few hours of solid time while leaving the evenings as a time when I can help out and be a &quot;family man.&quot;&#160; It still doesn&#8217;t feel natural but the payoff is that I can still advance my work with IronPython and other interests. It&#8217;s already been pointed out to me that my productivity here and other places has dropped since my daughter was born.</p>  <p>So question for other programmer/dad people: how do you work the family schedule? Any tips and tricks for a one month father who is still daydreaming about what it was like to sleep all night? </p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

Unsure when I linked to that article before (perhaps from you?), the methodology is fascinating even though I don&#8217;t understand the code.  Didn&#8217;t read the Comments on that one until just now.  Isn&#8217;t it interesting how a discussion about how to deal with an challenge can get derailed by a discussion of whether we should participate at all?   Lead me to ponder &#8230; &#8220;Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar&#8217;s, and to God the things that are God&#8217;s&#8217;&#8221;.  -ERD</div>

Good article but I&#8217;m not sure the thinking is complete (I&#8217;d have to think about it!).  There&#8217;s a big hole, MLB-quality pitchers are mentioned therefore the first baseline graph isn&#8217;t appropriate.  <BR/>Regarding your musing about whether it applies to programmers, don&#8217;t forget the curve depends alot on whether they&#8217;re being &#8220;pitched&#8221; by MLB-quality problems!<BR/>(There are plenty of good coders whose .401 average is because they&#8217;re fiddling with less than intricate business processes).</div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>I think it all started with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2008/10/29/update-on-linq-to-sql-and-linq-to-entities-roadmap.aspx">this post</a> from Tim Mallalieu reporting some directions for LINQ to SQL and the ADO.NET Entity Framework. <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/10/31/microsoft-kills-linq-to-sql.aspx">Ayende</a> and <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/david.hayden/archive/2008/10/31/linq-to-sql-is-dead-read-between-the-lines.aspx">others</a> have had some strong reactions (LINQ to SQL is dead) and there&#8217;s now a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/252683/is-linq-to-sql-doa">StackOverflow thread</a> you can use to follow the discussion. </p>  <p>It will be interesting to track over the next few days what other responses pop up. A few things that come to my mind: </p>  <p>1. This is an opening for people using Linq to SQL to migrate to SubSonic or NHibernate. I&#8217;ve been using SubSonic lately and enjoying myself quite a bit.</p>  <p>2. A big disappointment for people like <a href="http://blog.benday.com/">Benjamin Day</a> who I saw speak at VSLive and who have incoprorated LINQ to SQL into their development projects. Next time wait for Microsoft to 2.0 something before spending too much time working it into your dev cycle. </p>  <p>3. I wonder if Microsoft hasn&#8217;t thought of spinning off some of the tool makers as different companies. Perhaps there is an MBA out there who could draw some charts and convince management to have ADO.NET Entity Framework and the LINQ to SQL folks compete/copy in the same space. If the team isn&#8217;t fully formed, why not make one? And then how cool would that be: profit centers that encourage developers to use Microsoft tools and competition to get the best ideas out the door. The trade off of Balkanization versus One True Product is that the former will mean that cool new ideas belong to you - the company won&#8217;t have to get the ideas from outside sources.&#160; </p>  <p>4. I wonder if we aren&#8217;t moving towards a tipping point of Microsoft developers &quot;getting&quot; open source and shifting their tool/framework usage outside of Microsoft. I know lots of people who won&#8217;t use __anything__ unless it has a Microsoft logo because it feels safer and more commoditized. Moves like this seem to go against that since open source projects tend to live a longer time and technologies / frameworks from companies become &quot;obsolete&quot; (how many versions of ADO can you count?) because of a product cycle that requires new purchases every 2 years or so. I would argue with my boss on a new project that it&#8217;s safer to use NHibernate than ADO.NET Entity Framework if this indicates a chance that the Entity Framework could be the next LINQ to SQL project.</p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>Scott Hanselman did a survey of .NET usage and <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SurveyRESULTSWhatNETFrameworkFeaturesDoYouUse.aspx">posted results</a> on his blog. A few interesting notes:</p>  <p>1. Heavy use of older stuff: ASMX, DataSet, WebForms, Windows Forms   <br />You&#8217;d be hard pressed to find new blog entries on it but it shows that older (tried) technologies don&#8217;t sync up with what&#8217;s popular. The last few projects I&#8217;ve worked on have had development cycles that far exceed the excitement of their underpinning technology. One needs to remember that excitement and hype aren&#8217;t what make something useful, it&#8217;s use. So the people who talk down DataSets do so in the face of what obviously works for a silent majority who are busy getting stuff done.</p>  <p>2. Some new stuff won&#8217;t take, some new stuff takes off   <br />The respondents using CardSpace and WorkFlow are dismal. I can match the &quot;unscientific&quot; survey with a lot of my own experience in the last few years and conclude it&#8217;s within a broader trend. On the other hand, LINQ To SQL has very heavy use for something relatively new, almost on par with ADO DataSets which one could argue are in the same competitive space. That says to me that in some cases adoption is just slow when there&#8217;s a &quot;legacy&quot; counterpart for a technology but in others, when the new technology is compelling, people take to it very quickly.</p>  <p>3. WinForms &gt; WPF   <br />More than twice the respondents but here&#8217;s my conclusion: it&#8217;s all about the toolset, not the technology. WPFs tools are not on par with their WinForms equivalents. The dual Blend + VS strategy doesn&#8217;t make sense for a large majority of us who don&#8217;t have full time designers we work with and the lack of built in controls (such as a DataGridView) mean as cool as rounded edges are, function trumps form when programming.</p>  <p>4. MVC?   <br />Last I checked this was *just* released as a beta. More people claim to use that than WPF which seems to indicate a Hanselman type majority in respondents. Even if I wanted to jump into MVC, until it&#8217;s at a &quot;1.0&quot; release I couldn&#8217;t (and I&#8217;m wondering how others seem to be doing so) justify starting or migrating a major product to a product/framework that isn&#8217;t yet complete.</p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

Actually, to be fair I&#8217;ve been using MVC on a bunch of projects lately some minor (conference booking application) and some major (massive government application).  Frankly, at around preview 2-3 it was stable enough to build an app around even if I had to build some plumbing.<BR/><BR/>The major govt one is because we were looking to get ahead of the curve.  Part of this is driven by me having control over technical determinations for most/all projs I  am currently working on.</div>

<div class='content'>
MVC likely is being driven by two things &#8230; the Alt.NET movement and the fact that you have the source and can recompile for bug fixes if you need it.  Makes having a &#8220;baked&#8221; product less important.  Remember, for Open Source projects you get very little more than that in the way of promises and people use those technologies all the time.</div>

Some days ago I downloaded good mp3song in zip archive.And yesterday I decided to play it.But I couldn&#39;t extract the song.Fortunately my friend advised-<a href="http://www.recoverytoolbox.com/repair_zip.html" rel="nofollow">recovery file zip</a>.And in seconds after that I already was listening this song.</div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>A lot of people are down on Windows Forms as something passe. I have a feeling there are a lot of people like me who not only must use it for practical reasons but also think there are advantages to fat clients that sit on the Windows platform. I&#8217;m getting to a point where I will start doing more than poking around with WPF but at present two factors hold me at bay: the control library is not robust enough (another tutorial of how to make a custom button in blend isn&#8217;t incentive enough) and XAML is still a bit daunting for what usually end up being rather involved UIs. Here, for example, is a UI from an application I&#8217;ve been working on for a while (small intentionally to impart an idea of complexity without revealing any details):</p>  <p><img src="http://seruyange.com/metadeveloper/Torment.jpg" /> </p>  <p>I think a lot of &quot;do it in XAML&quot; problems can be solved with a more web development style paradigm in Windows. A simple example is template driven databinding with styles. That&#8217;s easy to do in web applications but a little less flexible in a control based world (think a GridView with CSS versus the Windows Forms DataGridView). </p>  <p>As a proof of concept I decided to use the System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser in a Windows Forms application to get cool features from JQuery while maintaining the strengths of a windows app. Here&#8217;s the scenario: a photo manager application. It builds and manages a database of photos from a digital camera. Rather than uploading the 300+ pictures taken in a single session to Flickr (or in conjunction with that act) one can open it up, start annotating their files and saving the comments to a portable &quot;database&quot; that they can back up along with the files on their home machine.&#160; On any machine with the application they point to the directory and can view their original comments along with the pictures. Here is a screen shot:</p>  <p><img src="http://seruyange.com/metadeveloper/Photobase.jpg" /> </p>  <p>The strength in this scenario of Windows Forms is the ease with which one can build the editing interface: textboxes, buttons and other &quot;drag / drop&quot; pieces of the control library. The strength of JQuery is in the display - I&#8217;ve chosen to use an animation and the accordion to spruce up the interface where the user looks at their photos.</p>  <p><a href="http://seruyange.com/metadeveloper/WibPhoto.zip">You can download the whole thing here</a>. (Very 0.1 but posted as an example/idea - just use the next / previous buttons to view some photos, get a feel of things).</p>  <p>I wonder if this paradigm can be a kind of Ajax &quot;aha&quot; moment; Ajax was centered on the use of a single, relatively simple MSXML component. Though System.Web.Forms.WebBrowser is not simple, it&#8217;s a single component that has a lot of room for leverage.&#160; Ajax set up some pretty standard protocols / approaches to using asynchronous HTTP requests from a client - I think an interesting parallel could exist in wrapping jQuery and Html controls into a kind of framework that is easy for any developer to use with the WebBrowser control. Imagine a grid you drop with some properties and a CSS.&#160; The last thing that made Ajax pop was the catchy name. I love naming things myself so I&#8217;ve been calling this kind of application a WIB (Windows + Web) but perhaps there&#8217;s something more catchy one could use.</p>  <p>Just some ideas, I&#8217;d be curious in the following: </p>  <p>1. Any existing applications written with this approach.    <br />2. Any potential applications that could benefit with the pros of both Windows and Web     <br />3. Any glaring shortfalls </p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>ps. Thanks to Corey for encouragement on the blogging tip.</p>  </div>
