The sooner you can start testing your ideas, the sooner you can start fixing them.  <p>I wrote the first version of Gmail in one day. It was not very impressive. All I did was stuff my own email into the Google Groups (Usenet) indexing engine. I sent it out to a few people for feedback, and they said that it was somewhat useful, but it would be better if it searched over their email instead of mine. That was version two. After I released that people started wanting the ability to respond to email as well. That was version three. That process went on for a couple of years inside of Google before we released to the world.</p></blockquote> <p>Interesting and it goes along with something Guy Kawasaki was saying in a recent podcast I <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2007/10/podcasts-i-think-big.html">commented on</a> hearing.&nbsp; So the next question comes down to technique - when you&#8217;re working on something by yourself, how do you schedule builds?&nbsp; I&#8217;m thinking I may start to take deliberate &#8220;coding vacations&#8221; - days I take off* from work in order to push through releases on my various little software projects.&nbsp; Hm&#8230; other thoughts?</p> <p>*My employer offers &#8220;comp days&#8221; so it&#8217;s not at the expense of my day job.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

Hey AJ, <BR/><BR/>I have the book but it&#8217;s been in my reading queue - I did read a few chapters though, the del.icio.us one and the one on Philip Greenspun.<BR/><BR/>I work a lot so I accumulate a good amount of comp time. But I&#8217;m not militant about taking the time off (feeling swamped with what I need to do) so it hasn&#8217;t been a clearly defined area.  The idea is that you take a day &#8220;when you need it.&#8221;  <BR/><BR/>It feels like I&#8217;m somewhat cheating myself though by not trying to keep track and be more militant about making sure I balance the whole &#8220;comp time&#8221; equation properly for what it was designed.</div>

So I know you said you were looking forward to reading the &#8220;Founders at Work&#8221; book (http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2007/02/founders-at-work.html), but did you ever? If not, there&#8217;s a great chapter on / by Paul Buchheit and Gmail. One of my favorite chapters and a really fun book to read.<BR/><BR/>So.. comp days at work. How often do you get them and how much direction are you given?</div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>If you&#8217;re like me, you spend a lot of time using System.IO and can easily check for the existence of a file on the filesystem with a File.Exists(@&#8221;C:\spam\eggs.file&#8221;)</p> <p>It&#8217;s a little surprising that I hadn&#8217;t run into it before but a few weeks ago I needed that same functionality with javascript. I found a few things online and what works best is using AJAX to make a request and check the HTTP status for whether or not the request failed.&nbsp; My approach was to use <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> and something like this:</p><pre style="background-color: #e0e0e0">function checkForFile(imgName, displayHolder){<br />    new Ajax.Request('Repo/' + imgName + '.jpg',   <br />        {<br />        method:'get',<br />        onSuccess: function(transport){   <br />            var response = transport.status || "no response text";   <br />            if(parseInt(response) == 200){<br />                displayHolder.src = 'Repo/' + imgName + '.jpg';<br />                displayHolder.style.display='block';<br />            }<br />        },     <br />        onFailure: function(){ <br />            displayHolder.src = 'Repo/NoImage.gif';<br />            displayHolder.style.display='block';<br />        }   <br />    });     <br />}<br /></pre><br /><p> Works like a charm.</p><br /><h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>I started changing my Visual Studio settings after seeing Hanselman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/VisualStudioProgrammerThemesGallery.aspx">post</a> and thought I&#8217;d be able to spit fire like John Lam once I&#8217;d downloaded <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/06/vibrant_ink_vis.html">his settings</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhHONpmlxPc">it&#8217;s gotta be</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYc3cZOkwPU&amp;feature=related">the shoes</a>!). The contrast was a bit much (though working in low light helped) and after a night&#8217;s worth of being like JLam I wanted to go back to (dare I admit?) VS default settings. That didn&#8217;t work out too well (even using the &#8220;default settings&#8221; option in VS, go figure) so I opted for <a href="http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/archive/2006/09/07/19030.aspx">Brad Wilson&#8217;s settings</a> which I&#8217;ve grown to like.</p> <p>When the IDE &#8220;hot or not&#8221; thing first cropped up I changed settings but what makes me <em>boring</em>, preferring the default, is that I&#8217;m on a lot of machines at different times; my laptop, desktop, remote on a couple of servers, and when I help others.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>Last year I was fortunate to catch <a href="http://www.scottmccloud.com/">Scott McCloud</a> here in Sioux Falls. It&#8217;s doubtful that he&#8217;d ever find his way here under normal circumstances but he was doing a 50 state tour in support of his book, &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Comics-Storytelling-Secrets-Graphic/dp/0060780940">Making Comics</a>.&#8221;&nbsp; I believe a dual aim was to provide his two young daughters, who travelled and presented with him, an experience of a lifetime.&nbsp; </p> <p>I was particularly struck with a classification he had for comic (and indeed all types) artists.&nbsp; He placed them into four quadrants:</p> <p><img src="http://seruyange.com/metadeveloper/mccloud02.jpg"> </p> <p>Here is a quote of <a href="http://webcomicsreview.com/?p=151">an explanation</a> of how the classifications work:</p> <blockquote> <p>Those who value draftsmanship the most, and who are the most invested in the idea of mastery, beauty, and craft find themselves on the opposite side of the fence from those whose strongest values are raw honesty, authenticity, and a kind of rebellion against the status quo. That dichotomy comes between what I call the classicists and the iconoclasts. The children of Hal Foster versus the children of R. Crumb.  <p>That’s the truth and beauty diagonal that separates two of the four tribes. The other two corners are the formalists and the animists, who represent the distinction between form and content. The formalists like to experiment and take the medium apart, figure out how it works and put it back together, and try new things; while the animists really just like to tell a compelling story, and want the form to vanish, to become transparent, so that you don’t know you’re reading a comic at all.</p></blockquote> <p>I wonder how well these notions apply to the practice of programming.&nbsp; I can easily see the classicist: mastery, beauty, and craft - the person who uses things like recursion excessively for the computer science elegance they bestow.&nbsp; Opposite them, I see the iconoclast -&nbsp; the hacks that make things work and could care less about the principles or structure of a thing and instead devote themselves to the beauty of experience. </p> <p>I think the animists and formalists can be distinguished as well by the metric of language/tool preference.&nbsp; The obsessives of language would seem to tend toward formalism and understanding every moving part.&nbsp; An animist may be the type of person who excels at making a tool do legwork with no particular interest in exactly what that tool is baking under the covers.&nbsp; </p> <p>Of course we all will have elements of each but I like to think of myself patterned after Scott McCloud. The formalist who might write the same software over and over in different languages just to see how expression and power vary at the lowest levels.</p> <p>Interesting food for thought.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>Ravi Mohan makes the provocative, if not new <a href="http://ravimohan.blogspot.com/2008/01/ratcatchers-and-engineers.html">claim</a> (with <a href="http://ravimohan.blogspot.com/2008/01/so-whats-wrong-if-you-arent-engineer.html">follow up</a>) that programmers are not engineers. I take the majority of his quibble to be the title some flaunt: &#8220;software engineer.&#8221;</p> <p>I&#8217;ve never felt able to use &#8220;engineer&#8221; for myself, but I don&#8217;t perceive this badly. My official title is &#8220;software architect&#8221; though most of my day is not spent on architecture.</p> <p>It&#8217;s a bit postmodern of me but<strong><em> does anyone&#8217;s title mean much?</em></strong>&nbsp; Short of very specialized work, one must have multiple skillsets for the different roles they are cast in on a daily basis. </p> <p>I have to do the following, fairly regularly:<br>1. Write Code<br>2. Write Specs<br>3. Customer Service<br>4. Testing<br>5. Write Proposals<br>6. Mentor<br>7. Marketing</p> <p>I&#8217;m owning up to a lot of stuff, particulary #7, that I would never admit to for the sake of saying that most jobs these days require multiple intelligences.</p> <p>Think <a href="http://www.calatrava.com/main.htm">Santiago Calatrava</a>: engineer, architect, artist. And he deals with clients, too.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
