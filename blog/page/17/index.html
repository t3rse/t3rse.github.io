I take the majority of his quibble to be the title some flaunt: &#8220;software engineer.&#8221;</p> <p>I&#8217;ve never felt able to use &#8220;engineer&#8221; for myself, but I don&#8217;t perceive this badly. My official title is &#8220;software architect&#8221; though most of my day is not spent on architecture.</p> <p>It&#8217;s a bit postmodern of me but<strong><em> does anyone&#8217;s title mean much?</em></strong>&nbsp; Short of very specialized work, one must have multiple skillsets for the different roles they are cast in on a daily basis. </p> <p>I have to do the following, fairly regularly:<br>1.

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>I did the switch back for a project that a VBA enlightened client requested but I kept finding myself asking how to syntactically do what I usually do in C# (especially inheritance-wise) in VB.NET.&nbsp; Terry Smith has a handy <a href="http://www.terrysmith.net/software/dotnet_ebook/index.html">online book</a> that has a comparison so that you can easily figure out what the VB.NET syntax is for what you know how to do in C#. I&#8217;m not sure when it was written; no word on Generics but that&#8217;s an easy enough syntax to duplicate with (Of T) rather than angle brackets.&nbsp; What throws me off in addition to the inheritance verbosity are a lot of the array related casting operations that seem intuitive now in C# like:</p> <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">Dim dropRows As Row() = e.Data.GetData(GetType(Row()))</font></p> <p>Of course with the latest developments in VB.NET, I may end up using the language enough to make all of this easy to recall from memory.&nbsp; </p> <p>As much as I want to join the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CategoryView.aspx?category=VB">Red Sox fans</a> in cheering for VB, there are still many things that annoy me about the language.&nbsp; Line continuation characters are at the top of the list, and case insensitivity closely following. Yes, I strongly dislike case insensitivity in a programming language.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

Hey David,<BR/><BR/>Thanks for the link to my eBook! <BR/><BR/>It&#8217;s getting a bit dated now I admit. I haven&#8217;t updated it since .NET 1.1. <BR/><BR/>I&#8217;m glad some folks are still finding it useful though!<BR/><BR/>Terry</div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>A while back I had a phone call from a woman with an eastern European accent wondering if I would be willing to take a survey.&nbsp; I&#8217;m usually an instant no to queries like this but she knew my Achilles heel: <br><br>&#8220;Participants get $50 Amazon Gift Certificate&#8221;</p> <p>So a few days ago my inbox chimed with an email with the gift certificate in tow. I didn&#8217;t hesitate with my purchase of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596516177?tag=davidflanagancom&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0596516177&amp;adid=1B3W8X81CQ0JC1RK934N&amp;">David Flanagan&#8217;s Ruby book</a>.&nbsp; </p> <p>As an aside, it seems that Flanagan got some <a href="http://www.davidflanagan.com/blog/2008_01.html#000149">flack</a> from a Gilles Bowkett on not being a bona fide Ruby person. If Flanagan isn&#8217;t <em>cultured enough</em> to do Ruby, I&#8217;m in trouble&#8230; </p> <p>&#8230; but I&#8217;ve been in trouble most of my short puff anyway.</p> <p>On a serious note: the &#8220;up in the club&#8221; attitude of some (okay, mostly Rails) Ruby people is what is driving a <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming/info/666i4/comments/">backlash</a> against Rails and Ruby in general.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

Also, there&#8217;s just one L. Giles, not Gilles. &#8220;Jy-ulz&#8221;, not &#8220;Jeel.&#8221; Giles is British, Gilles would be French.</div>

On the one hand, David F. sent me a really angry e-mail which, and this is unusual for angry e-mails, was full of logical argument, and which really delivered more fairness than my anti-Flanagan screed had earned. So I have to give him full credit. I felt like I&#8217;d been a total dick.<BR/><BR/>On the other hand, there is a kind of locusts effect going on in the Ruby/Rails community. As long as I can buy groceries and such, I&#8217;m totally willing to risk a backlash, because I think the forward-lash was really overkill. Ruby doesn&#8217;t need to be such a big deal. It&#8217;s not supposed to be the next big thing. It&#8217;s supposed to be an enjoyable language to code in.<BR/><BR/>People who only notice a community once it becomes a profitable market, and who come to a community looking for ways to exploit it, are going to create remarkably different books from people who love a community and became part of it long ago when no money was at stake.<BR/><BR/>Since I discovered Ruby via Rails, I came in with the first wave of locusts, but I have to say the old-schoolers who do it because it makes them happy appeal to me very much more than someone who&#8217;s written a bunch of stuff for a dominant publisher based at least partly on what the market seems to want at any particular time.<BR/><BR/>I would very emphatically recommend picking up Hal Fulton&#8217;s book before even giving Flanagan&#8217;s a chance at all.<BR/><BR/>It&#8217;s true there&#8217;s snobbery in the Rails world and it&#8217;s true that for the most part it&#8217;s nothing to be proud of. If it&#8217;s any consolation, I antagonized David Hansson, who created Rails and is therefore the absolute definition of Rails &#8220;cool,&#8221; at least as badly as I antagonized Flanagan. Don&#8217;t go misjudging an entire community just because I have this incredible way of pissing people off. I&#8217;m kind of thinking that that&#8217;s just me.</div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>I just looked at Oliver Steele&#8217;s <a href="http://osteele.com/archives/2008/01/programmers-pyramid">programmer&#8217;s food pyramid</a> and did a self evaluation of sorts. I know that I err too much on the reading of &#8220;blogs&#8221; versus reading long prose about programming.&nbsp; That&#8217;s something to change this year.</p> <p>As well I use libraries a lot without digging into anything once my problem solving is done.&nbsp; I think there&#8217;s a form of mental stamina in digging deeper into a problem once you&#8217;ve apparently solved it - my instinct is to simply move on and try to tackle what&#8217;s next.&nbsp; Now that the .NET Framework code is <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/01/16/net-framework-library-source-code-now-available.aspx">available</a>, that and <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/">other</a> <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">libraries</a> should occupy my reading time.</p> <p>While I don&#8217;t struggle with the inclination to write code, I&#8217;ve long since thought it&#8217;s better to try to write different types of applications and build some breadth.&nbsp; Especially after my umpteenth web based CRUD app, I&#8217;m now interested in blending Windows Forms and Web stuff in the small variety of utilities that I compulsively write.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>In the wake of all the plastic surgery and body augmentation going on around, a developer like myself can feel a little out of place - out of century to be more exact.&nbsp; </p> <p>And yet, whether he&#8217;s joking or not, I&#8217;m half tempted by Wesner&#8217;s <a href="http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/2008/01/performance-enh.html">admission</a> to &#8220;performance enhancers.&#8221; </p> <p>But the thing I know with certainty is that being productive will only beget the desire to be more productive.

&#8220;Just one more language&#8230; one more and then I&#8217;ll be fine&#8230;&#8221;<BR/><BR/>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this the last couple weeks.  (1) I&#8217;m in danger of letting work take over my life.  (2). OTOH, isn&#8217;t it great to have a job that so fun that you kind of *want* it to take over your life?</div>

I drink a good amount of coffee at work but not nearly as much as I used to. I assume that would be considered the default performance enhancer for many programmers. I also find that if I stay up late I get a nice boost of energy around 10pm, midnight and 2am. I personally think finding your own personal biorhythm and combining with a small amount of coffee if you need to boost your lows is the best policy to sustained productivity and a healthy body and brain.</div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>I earned the reputation as &#8220;the guy from South Dakota&#8221; at CodeMash; many people were amazed that I took it upon myself to drive just under 14 hours both there and back for the conference.</p> <p>What would they have done if I told them I also:<br>a) took time off from work<br>b) paid for it out of pocket<br>c) drove my own car</p> <p>But I think it&#8217;s not *that* strange. Staying at work would have meant the same old stuff I do every day all year and instead I got to see some of the best Einstein&#8217;s presenting on Python, DSLs, Dojo, REST, and IIS7. I made some friends as well and on top of that got to kick it with Scott Hanselman.&nbsp; All for the cost of a long drive with an audio book.</p> <p>I had <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2007/12/codemash-i-be-there.html">posted</a> on sessions I wanted to see, here&#8217;s a little rundown of memorable sessions I actually attended:</p> <p>1. <a href="http://www.nealford.com/">Neal Ford&#8217;s</a> keynote &#8221;<em>Software Engineering &amp; Polyglot Programming</em>&#8221;</p> <p>Neal&#8217;s one of those sedate cognoscenti who don&#8217;t appear to have an emotional angle on platforms, just a sense of design and engineering that they wish to communicate.&nbsp; In his talk he urged developers towards the notion of language as a tool, and that dynamic languages take us places that our old friends in the static realm cannot.&nbsp; He made a reference to <a href="http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design_main.html">Jack Reeve&#8217;s essay</a> which I&#8217;ve <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2006/06/code-as-design-implications-for.html">written about</a> before, and said a few times the following phrase which I thought was apt: <br>&#8220;Testing is the engineering rigor of software development.&#8221; </p> <p>If I could have asked Neal, I&#8217;d have wanted some comment on something I posted some time back - Oliver Steele&#8217;s blog post on <a href="http://osteele.com/archives/2004/11/ides">The IDE Divide</a> in which he divides developers into the Language Mavens and Tool Mavens.&nbsp; I think Neal&#8217;s perspective was very much that of a language versus tool maven.</p> <p>2. <a href="http://catherinedevlin.blogspot.com/">Catherine Devlin&#8217;s</a> &#8221;<em>Crash, Smash, Kaboom Course in Python</em>&#8221; <br>Great talk on Python fundamentals while illustrating a universe simulator library (forget the name).&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been trying to pick up Python for some time and much of what I got was from watching Catherine&#8217;s use of the language in her demos.&nbsp; The one bummer: I was using a Python distribution from my iBook (Mac OSX) that didn&#8217;t include the Python modules she was demonstrating with. Even more of a bummer: in my hotel room a different laptop was running Ubuntu with just the modules needed to follow along with her in code.</p> <p>3. <a href="http://www.blueskyonmars.com/">Kevin Dangoor</a> on Dojo<br>I may have made Kevin feel uncomfortable with how happy I was to see this talk (he did a great job) but I&#8217;ve felt quite alone over the last two-ish years working with javascript libraries.&nbsp; I used jQuery heavily for my tool &#8221;<a href="http://www.t3rse.com/proper/">proper</a>&#8221; after which I used Prototype/Scriptaculous for a few other projects.&nbsp; I then switched to YUI for <a href="http://www.nregex.com">nRegex</a> so I&#8217;d been around the block with my frameworks with only Dojo missing.&nbsp; Dojo seems to go beyond these other frameworks just on its ambition alone and I&#8217;m wondering if that can translate into a happy mix with the heavyweight stuff I have to do at work with ASP.NET.&nbsp; </p> <p>4. <a href="http://www.diditwith.net/">Dustin Campbell</a> on F#<br>Dustin gave a deft introduction to the F# language which had to be the biggest thoughtbludgeon I got during the conference.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve listed F# as <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2007/12/someday-language-f.html">my &#8220;someday language&#8221;</a> and it will remain so since Ruby will occupy my time along with Python in learning mode over the next year or so. Nevertheless, it was good to see a demonstration of the language and some of the implications thereof.</p> <p>5. Kevin Dangoor on Gears and Dojo (DojoX Offline)<br>The second session I sat in on with Kevin, this dealing with Dojo&#8217;s offline capabilities in large part courtesy of Google Gears.&nbsp; It was as good as the first Dojo session and left my mind popping with ideas for leveraging that functionality.&nbsp; <br>Soon - I&#8217;d say around the release of Silverlight 2.0 - people like me are going to face a fork in the road of using browser plugins and thick (they use the word &#8220;rich&#8221;) vendor technologies, or using javascript and existing web technologies like CSS on a new level.&nbsp; All the Dojo stuff represents, to me, what Microsoft and Adobe (no need to even mention JavaFX, oops I just did) are not tuning to as they ramp up Silverlight and Flex.&nbsp; Not that it&#8217;s in their interests: the stuff of web standards isn&#8217;t really the profit center that proprietary technologies are.</p> <p>6. Neal Ford on DSLs with Dynamic Languages<br>Neal was impressive this second time with some practical talk and examples of DSLs.&nbsp; He started first with Groovy, which left me disappointed since I don&#8217;t anticipate using it, but to show the &#8220;best&#8221; world he switched to Ruby.&nbsp; I am really looking forward to IronRuby&#8217;s release, but at present I think much of what he discussed can be implemented in Python.&nbsp; </p> <p>7. <a href="http://www.arcware.net/">Dave Donaldson</a> on RESTful Web Services<br>I&#8217;ve been familiar with the REST buzzword for some time but as a term thrown out in competition with standard web services (the WS-* stuff).&nbsp; Dave did a good job of unpacking the essence of REST and showing demonstrations of usage.&nbsp; It&#8217;s interesting to see just how much backlash there is against WS-* and the manufactured complexity therein.&nbsp; <strike>The only thing I disagreed with was Dave belittling</strike> Dave expressed reservations about the <a href="http://astoria.mslivelabs.com/">Astoria</a> project teetering into the over-engineered realm of WS-* but I am hopeful it will retain its original intent - I really, really like the idea of Astoria (born of the same backlash to WS-*? I&#8217;m just talking here&#8230;).<br></p> <p>8. <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/blog">Scott Hanselman</a> on Mashups with IIS7<br>He has the gift and he knows it: first with a humorous prologue and then with a good presentation on IIS7 and using its underpinnings with a mix of PHP. Inspired by Bill Staples <a href="http://blogs.iis.net/bills/archive/2006/10/31/PHP-on-IIS.aspx">article</a> on IIS7 and PHP, but with the detail and demonstrations with which Scott&#8217;s earned his following.</p> <p>I went to a few other sessions too, but these were the ones which, as the Brits say, &#8220;tickled my fancy.&#8221;&nbsp; I was disappointed to miss out on <a href="http://jrwren.wrenfam.com/blog/">Jay Wren&#8217;s</a> intro to Castle as well as <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=beckel">Bruce Eckel&#8217;s</a> thoughts on Python. I guess there&#8217;s next year&#8230; </p> <p>&#8230; and I do anticipate returning to CodeMash although I&#8217;m quite sure I&#8217;ll fly rather than driving. :^)<br></p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

Modified accordingly, I hope I am more accurate with the edit. <BR/><BR/>I&#8217;ve got you subbed in my aggregator, so consider me a lurker now.</div>

Belittling Astoria was not my intent, as I have high hopes for that project as well. I just hope it can deliver and not be over-engineered like so many other things.<BR/><BR/>Anyway, glad you could make it to the show and maybe we can chat more next year.<BR/><BR/>&#8211;Dave Donaldson</div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>I usually try not to be an echo chamber, especially when posts show up on Coding Horror or Steve Yegge&#8217;s blog. But what&#8217;s interesting is a rebuttle to a notion that Yegge <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/12/codes-worst-enemy.html">started</a>, namely that <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001025.html">size is an enemy</a> in code base.</p> <p>Franz Bouma has an <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma/archive/2007/12/24/codebase-size-isn-t-the-enemy.aspx">interesting post</a> to follow up that is worth a counter balance of views.</p> <p><strong>Conventions:</strong></p> <p>I <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2007/04/how-much-code-do-you-write.html">commented once</a> about LoC in one of our projects, not so much with an interest in maintainability, but as a comparison with how much code was being &#8220;generated&#8221; on my behalf by the IDE.&nbsp; The project has grown since that post which had the codebase at around 30,000 lines of code.&nbsp; This is nowhere near the 500,000 line mark but one design decision made early on that has always helped in navigating around was the heavy use of conventions.&nbsp; Because we followed a pattern for where we put things, it&#8217;s easy to find which project a piece of code is in as well as which part of the code one needs to dive into to make a modification.&nbsp; </p> <p><strong>Abstraction: </strong></p> <p>One thing I&#8217;m noticing about the open source projects I look at is how layers of abstraction can lead to the kind of indirection that&#8217;s hard to follow.&nbsp; I speak only of ideals but it seems like too much abstraction can lead to the kind of confusing codebases that people online are reacting to. That logic may be the Mort in me going against the grain; it seems like many think that indirection and abstraction may add flexibility, but that flexibility will be a trade off for how easily a person, especially not the original author, finds their way.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p><em>The short version:</em> <br>I&#8217;m releasing xPathFinder, a tool I wrote for doing XPATH expressions against xml files on the file system. You can get information about it as a tool by going to the <a href="http://www.t3rse.com/xPathFinder">website</a>. Here are some screenshots:</p> <p><img src="http://www.t3rse.com/xPathFinder/Screen1_small.jpg"> </p> <p><img src="http://www.t3rse.com/xPathFinder/Screen2_small.jpg">&nbsp; </p> <p><img src="http://www.t3rse.com/xPathFinder/Screen3_small.jpg"> </p> <p><em>The long version:</em><br>Not too long ago I ran into a problem that I thought would be common but didn&#8217;t seem to have a canned solution. We use a webservice to store some data in a database but we also store the xml files transmitted on the file system as a defensive maneuver in case the database is unavailable or the xml is invalid. After a while I was dealing with a lot of xml files - far too many to search one at a time and needing more structured lookup than a desktop search tool offered. This is the raison d&#8217;etre of this tool. Of course it could have been a quick script in -insert language of choice- but this was something I needed to do repeatedly and have more facility with than console output. I&#8217;m also planning to make it simple enough for our client to use. It was a goal of mine to get it up before the end of the year so I&#8217;m happily posting this a day early. </p> <p>One more footnote to this tool - stylistically I&#8217;ve done quite a bit of blending between Windows Forms and Web by leveraging the WebBrowser control heavily for things I thought would be easier to quickly generate html for as well as the feedback mechanism which allows users to report bugs or request features. It&#8217;s so tightly coupled that while it will work without an internet connection, it&#8217;s a much more limited experience. I really like this model and will probably start doing more blending like this for new work.</p> <p>You can get more detail from <a href="http://www.t3rse.com/xPathFinder/">the website</a> or just ask directly by <a href="http://www.t3rse.com/xPathFinder/SubmitFeedback.html">submitting feedback</a>.</p> <p>Future plans?</p> <p>1. XPATH functionality works for most xml documents, but namespace heavy documents with prefixes seem to throw a curve ball. <br>2. What I&#8217;m posting was actually a fast prototype I intended to use to make this tool in WPF from - I&#8217;m not sure that the WPF step is still necessary but I may release an updated version since this is a fairly straight forward utility.<br>3. I&#8217;d like to make it open source. Not sure of what steps to follow, but CodePlex is probably the best starting point. I always promise myself I&#8217;ll clean up my code before doing something like that but maybe I should just bite the bullet since I think the idea is sound enough.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
