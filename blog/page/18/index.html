<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>Once or twice people have confused what I&#8217;m doing with sales. Some time back I met with a prospective client and kept having to explain that I actually do write code and would probably be a lead developer on any work they gave us. The reaction I had for even the mere perception that I was &#8220;sales&#8221; was a little surprising to myself although with some reflection I realized it was because I conflated most of what I disliked about salesmen into an image I couldn&#8217;t deal with for myself: </p> <ul> <li>Style over substance</li> <li>Shallow understanding</li> <li>Pandering for a quick buck</li></ul> <p>But once in my life I was a happy salesman. Some time back I pushed the company I worked for into adopting FogBugz and really building a large part of our lifecycle around it. I did so enthusiastically after reading Joel&#8217;s early essays on bug tracking and seeing how well it applied to our situation.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve seen other bug tracking software since but still think the FogBugz experience was best.&nbsp; It seems simple, but because of how much thought has gone into the product, I gather a lot of work has gone into keeping it stripped from unnecessary features.</p> <p>To be clear, I don&#8217;t work as a bona fide &#8220;in house&#8221; developer. But as a consulting company, I spend a lot of time playing that role or working with people in it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s therefore conflicting when I read his understanding of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/04.html">what it means</a> to work in house. Phil Haack had it right in the middle of 2005 when he <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2005/07/26/9027.aspx">wrote</a> of the irony of this disdain towards the people that would be excited to use his software in the first place.</p> <p>I wonder what kind of conditioning it is - maybe that I&#8217;ve liked musical artists who are fairly open about loathing their fanbase - but I still miss the simplicity and elegance of FogBugz.&nbsp; </p> <p>What&#8217;s sad these days is that as much as I&#8217;d like to slip on the poorly fitting suit and do my sales routine, we get Sharepoint for free (okay, not free but let&#8217;s just say Microsoft does an excellent job making it seem so) and it&#8217;s the environment in which we track what I&#8217;d gotten my previous company to use FogBugz for so effectively.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not a big Sharepoint fan (that&#8217;s an understatement) so I&#8217;d even be tempted to go The Powers That Be and ask for FogBugz if I couldn&#8217;t predict the answer right away.</p> <p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be unflustered but I&#8217;ve got a few comments on what it&#8217;s like to be in house: </p> <p>1. In a small enough company, <strong>it&#8217;s great to have decision making power</strong>.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve used technologies like Ajax and Perl where a larger environment would have involved committee meetings with some manager shooting me down for doing things differently. You don&#8217;t have to be a renegade to do this, just document what you do well and communicate with anyone you&#8217;re working with that may have to look at it on your behalf.</p> <p>2. In consulting it helps a lot to <strong>condition your client</strong>.&nbsp; First build confidence with a track record of success, after which the client is usually willing to listen to you when you&#8217;d like to do things &#8220;right&#8221; or improve a piece of software even if it&#8217;s getting by functionally.&nbsp; After a while, depending on the client, they will usually just trust your judgement and stay away from technical arguments unless there&#8217;s some disproportionate cost.</p> <p>3. <strong>Software is never finished</strong>.&nbsp; This is true even for what is developed in house.&nbsp; As a result the process of continual improvement still exists.&nbsp; It takes a tremendous amount of discipline to try to develop things right when there&#8217;s a small budget or a tight deadline but I always think of those moments I&#8217;ve spent late at night hacking the ugliest workarounds because of a bad initial effort. Most of the time finishing when it&#8217;s &#8220;good enough&#8221; is about the taste and craftsmanship of the person who writes the software; whether they tried to think of the future or not.</p> <p>4. From working in both a &#8220;software company&#8221; and a &#8220;consulting company&#8221; I understand that <strong>software development is always a process of coming to terms with friction</strong> - all the unexpected realities and circumstances of real life and real users. Different places will have different kinds of friction; where an in house developer may have to deal with the kind of discipline it takes to write unit tests on a deadline a programmer at a software company may have the dilemma of trying to be all things to all people. </p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>I maintain a few personal websites, one of the closest to my heart is <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/phoDak">phoDak</a>, a photoblog.&nbsp; I wrote the site using ASP.NET about two years ago and intended it to be a low key, personal area to post pictures.&nbsp; I had absolutely no validation on comments and my &#8220;what will be&#8221; attitude worked for a long time until about a week ago when I saw a comment spam link to porn right off the most recent picture.&nbsp; No longer avoidable, I looked into a few ways to block unwanted comments and came up with a hybrid approach: </p> <p>1. Use a photo/word as validation for a human user, just like <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Jeff Atwood&#8217;s</a> blog.<br>2. I heard about <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> from Phil Haack who mentioned it in passing on a Dot Net Rocks episode. I found a <a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/2006/04/18/akismet-anti-spam-library-for-the-dotnet-framework/">free library</a> and wrote about 10 lines of code:</p><pre style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 8pt; background: #000; padding-bottom: 10px; margin: 1em 0px; overflow: auto; width: 500px; color: #eee; padding-top: 10px; font-family: verdana">AkismetManager akismetManager = <br />	new AkismetManager("my key", "my site");<br />string ip = <br />	Request.ServerVariables["REMOTE_ADDR"].ToString();<br />if(akismetManager.IsValidKey()){<br />	AkismetItem item = <br />		new AkismetItem(ip, Request.UserAgent.ToString());<br />	item.AuthorName = <br />		CommentOwnerTextbox.Text;<br />	item.AuthorUrl = <br />		CommentURLTextbox.Text;<br />	item.Content = <br />		CommentTextbox.Text;<br />	if(akismetManager.IsSpam(item)){<br />		akismetManager.SubmitSpam(item);<br />		return;<br />	}<br />}<br /></pre><br /><p>Q.E.D., really. Somewhat Mort-ish for me to lean solely on the library but it works beautifully: my spam comments since implementation remain at absolute zero.</p><br /><h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>On a whim I&#8217;ve signed up to be at CodeMash 2008.&nbsp; After learning about the conference when Hanselman posted he&#8217;d keynote, I mapped out that Sandusky, OH (Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot!) is none too far (an audio book&#8217;s worth of distance). </p> <p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to the opportunity to walk among <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001004.html">Elvis and Einstein</a>, hopefully gleaning some direction along the way. The <a href="http://www.codemash.org/SessionList.aspx">session list</a> is impressive, I&#8217;m thinking it will be hard to choose a particular direction. </p> <p>I&#8217;ve been studying Python of late, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=beckel">Bruce Eckel&#8217;s</a> <em>Why I Love Python</em>. Another interestingly titled Python presentation <em>Crash, Smash, Kaboom Course in Python</em> will be run by MIT alum <a href="http://catherinedevlin.blogspot.com/">Catherine Devlin</a>.&nbsp; Finally on the Python front, I&#8217;ll try to squeeze into the Getting Started with Django session. </p> <p>On the &#8220;indy&#8221; .NET programming, I&#8217;m interested in the <em>Introducing Castle</em> session from <a href="http://jrwren.wrenfam.com/blog/">Jay R. Wren</a>. Because Hanselman is going to be there I can&#8217;t imagine no mention of ASP.NET MVC stuff, so hopefully it will somehow be mentioned at least comparatively.</p> <p><a href="http://silverlight.net/blogs/jesseliberty/">Jesse Liberty</a> is going to present on Silverlight, so that&#8217;s something I won&#8217;t miss either. There are other Microsoft technology presentations I should see but it would be hard to sit in on a Sharepoint session when I could be learning Python design patterns.</p> <p>The other area of interest I&#8217;ll have is the Dojo stuff, two sessions in particular: Overview of the Dojo JavaScript Toolkit and Working Offline with Dojo+Google Gears, both by <a href="http://www.blueskyonmars.com/">Kevin Dangoor</a>.</p> <p>Well, it should be interesting from start to finish, I&#8217;ll be working on my note taking skills so that I can share what I do learn.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="http://www.codemash.org/"><img alt="CodeMash &ndash; I&amp;apos;ll be there!" src="http://www.codemash.org/images/bloggerbadge2008.gif"></a></p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>LifeHacker has <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/screenshot-tour/first-look-at-firefox-30-319968.php">a first look</a> at the forthcoming Firefox 3. It&#8217;s interesting to see lots of improvements to the storage and management of places visited online - I&#8217;m sure this will provide inspiration for the Internet Explorer team at Microsoft to implement cool new features too.</p> <p>A feature I asked for (and got a skeptical response) was the ability to do what Firefox seems to aim for but in a Google-ish way. That is to say that it would be nice to have a browser history management/search capability that precluded real effort in organization. In simpler terms, the whole &#8220;search, don&#8217;t sort&#8221; experience one has with Gmail, except with browsing history and favorites.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1></div>

<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>I&#8217;ve been experimenting with IronPython of late trying to get the gestalt of Python as a language.&nbsp; It occurred to me that something I had been thinking about for a while as a web project would make sense as an Iron Python project so I dabbled a bit.</p> <p>The idea I had was a command line type application that approximated commands going to a windows shell and sent the results back to the user.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a part of a larger suspicion that I&#8217;ve had: that command lines are crisp, efficient user interfaces that are easy to lose sight of because it&#8217;s not a natural way of thinking on the web.</p> <p>The screen shots tell you the basic story: you open your browser to nothing but an underlined textbox after which you type your command and press the enter key.&nbsp; </p> <p><a href="http://www.seruyange.com/metadeveloper/eru1.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img height="275" src="http://www.seruyange.com/metadeveloper/eru1.jpg" width="406"></a> </p> <p><a href="http://www.seruyange.com/metadeveloper/eru2.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img height="402" src="http://www.seruyange.com/metadeveloper/eru2.jpg" width="407"></a> </p> <p>The client code is pretty straight forward - I&#8217;ve become disillusioned with YUI and moved back to using Prototype:</p> <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">function runCommand(cmd){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var request = new Ajax.Request(<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8216;eruServer.aspx&#8217;, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parameters:&#8217;cmd=&#8217; + cmd, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; onComplete: handleResult <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; );<br>}</font> <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">function handleResult(response){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $(&#8216;loaderImage&#8217;).style.visibility = &#8216;hidden&#8217;; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var cmdResult = response.responseText;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $(&#8216;stdoutDiv&#8217;).innerHTML = &#8216;&lt;pre&gt;&#8217; + cmdResult + &#8216;&lt;/pre&gt;&#8217;;<br>}</font> <p>So that&#8217;s all pretty simple, on the server processing the request is equally simple in IronPython. </p> <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">from System.Diagnostics import *<br>from System.IO import * </font> <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">def Page_Load(sender, e):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cmd = Request.cmd<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p = Process()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.StartInfo.FileName = &#8220;cmd.exe&#8221;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = 0<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.StartInfo.CreateNoWindow = 1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.StartInfo.RedirectStandardInput = 1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = 1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.Start() <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myOut = p.StandardInput<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myIn = p.StandardOutput&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myOut.WriteLine(cmd)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.StandardInput.Flush() <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.StandardInput.Close()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output = myIn.ReadToEnd()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.StandardOutput.Close()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.Dispose() <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response.Write(Server.HtmlEncode(output)) </font> <p>The web project is fairly small - go ahead and <a href="http://www.seruyange.com/metadeveloper/ERU.zip">download it here</a>. If you have any improvement, let me know - I&#8217;m not sure how to start this as an &#8220;open source&#8221; affair but it would be a great solution as a light weight tool for remotely operating on a server.</p> <p>Oh yeah, security: I was thinking of simple NTFS permissions on the files along with Windows Security on the website.&nbsp; Should do the trick&#8230; </p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1></div>

<p><font color="#0000ff" size="5">{</font></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There are some great videos at the <a href="http://www.businessinnovationfactory.com/innovationstorystudio/">Business Innovation Factory</a> - </p> <p><a href="http://www.businessinnovationfactory.com/innovationstorystudio/bif3_jfried.php">Jason Freid</a> (37 Signals) - <br>I&#8217;ve been watching these guys for a long time. Although I&#8217;m a little resistant to some of the accolades associated with them, the 37 Signals crew thinks clearly and has a clear identity with which they seem overwhelmingly successful.<br>My favorite comment is Jason saying that they (37 Signals) want to be &#8220;enemies of mediocrity.&#8221;</p> <p><a href="http://www.businessinnovationfactory.com/innovationstorystudio/bif3_rswurman.php">Richard Saul Wurman</a> - <br>I first learned about Wurman from TechTV&#8217;s &#8220;Big Thinker&#8221; series - although he is trained as an architect his career spans the sort of multidisciplinary mix that makes him special. He originated the TED conferences which have become quite popular of late. He&#8217;s got an interesting new project called <a href="http://www.192021.org/">19:20:21</a>, be sure to check out the information graphics.</p> <p><a href="http://www.businessinnovationfactory.com/innovationstorystudio/bif3_cchristensen.php">Clay Christensen</a> - <br>One of the most interesting thinkers in the theory of business at present.&nbsp; I wonder if Clay is more an economist than what one would consider a conventional &#8220;business&#8221; person. His gifts as a teacher shine through in this particular presentation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><font color="#0000ff" size="5">}</font></p></div>
