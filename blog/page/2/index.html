<h3><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h3>  <p>Eons ago <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2009/09/fizzbuzz-functional.html">I&#8217;d posted</a> on how I’d rewritten how I would solve FizzBuzz to have a more functional style (<a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2007/03/fizbuzz-conundrum-ramanujan.html">here</a> is an imperative version), inspired by Tomas Petricek and John Skeet’s <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek/">Functional Programming for the Real World</a>. Shortly thereafter I had written a version in F#, I’m not sure what prevented me from posting it but here it is: </p>  <pre style="padding-bottom: 10px; line-height: 120%; margin: 1em 0px; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; font-family: courier; background: #000; color: #eee; font-size: 12pt; overflow: auto; padding-top: 10px">let numbers = [1..100]<br />let fizz num = <br />    let res = if (num % 3 = 0) then &quot;fizz&quot; else &quot;&quot;<br />    res<br /><br />let buzz num = <br />    let res = if (num % 5 = 0) then &quot;buzz&quot; else &quot;&quot;<br />    res<br /><br />let outform num fizCalc = <br />    let res = if(fizCalc.ToString().Length &gt; 0) then fizCalc.ToString() else num.ToString()<br />    res<br /><br />let rec printer nums =<br />    match nums with<br />    | [] -&gt; printfn &quot;-&quot;<br />    | h::t -&gt;         <br />        printfn &quot;%s&quot; (outform h ((fizz h) + (buzz h)))<br />        printer t<br /><br />printer numbers</pre><br /><br /><p>I can already see now areas that are still influenced by the C# - most notably the use of <strong>if</strong> rather than using match for everything. I will clean it up, hopefully demonstrating an increased facility with F#. If you are looking at the above and know F#, what are some idioms or language constructs that I am neglecting in the above code? Type annotations for one&#8230; what else? </p><br /><br /><h3><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h3>  </div>

<h3><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h3>  <p>Given the amount of information that is out there it’s difficult to throttle back and actually digest it. A quick look at any web page will set that context; hit StackOverflow and you’ve got several dozens of links to follow, each a rabbit hole on its own. The same can be said for Hacker News, Channel 9, and just about every other popular developer site that is out there. </p>  <p>What tools exist to process this more efficiently? Perhaps, I hope, one of the oldest tools out there: <strong>email</strong>.</p>  <p>I came across this solution reading the Washington Post’s email newsletter I subscribe to one morning. I realized I’d get more out of the news by scheduling a more deliberate reading of the newsletter than by going to the site and being bombarded by stories and links that, while no doubt interesting, would result in an overflow of words that would invariably lose their depth. </p>  <p>I decided for the next week not to visit any news site directly but rather to subscribe to several newsletters and schedule the reading from directly from my email inbox. I also turned off the radio so that rather than hearing multiple versions of syndicated stories from the Associated Press, I would be able to dive more deeply and think more at length about what I read. The goal was to buck <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jan/27/internet.pressandpublishing">the trends</a> of the modern day information seeker: </p>  <blockquote>   <p><font size="4">“characterised as being &#8216;horizontal, bouncing, checking and viewing in nature. Users are promiscuous, diverse and volatile.&#8217; &#8216;Horizontal&#8217; information-seeking means &#8216;a form of skimming activity, where people view just one or two pages from an academic site then &quot;bounce&quot; out, perhaps never to return.&#8217; The average times users spend on e-book and e-journal sites are very short: typically four and eight minutes respectively.”</font></p> </blockquote>  <p>I wanted to get more vertical with my reading rather than surfing through multiple versions of the same piece of news.</p>  <p>I was so pleased with the results that I decided to use the same strategy with technical news and articles. I have long been a member of <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/">The Code Project</a> and of the software development newsletters I receive (surprisingly few) theirs is probably the best. Each day, and then in a weekly digest, there is an email in my inbox with a decent roundup of technical articles. Although not all of them pertain to my skills set or interests, there are usually one or two good links to follow up with; in <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Mailouts/View.aspx?mlid=8588">this newsletter</a> received on the last day of the year I could easily spend an hour on <a href="http://www.switched.com/2010/12/30/best-technology-writing-of-2010/">The Best Technology Writing of 2010</a> or catch up with Rob Connery giving <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/microsoft/hey-kid-come-over-here">his sentiments</a> on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/">BizSpark</a>. </p>  <p>The experiment will continue and although I do admit to “skimming” from time to time, even the tepid commitment that I’ve made seems to make my time online much more efficient. The next steps regarding newsletters is to find some more development related ones that come in a digest form, preferably weekly so that I can spend a full week on the contents. </p>  <h3><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h3>  </div>

<h3><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h3>  <p><strong>Goal Setting</strong></p>  <p>I’ve let it slip that one personal goal for 2011 is a more regimented information diet. I’m becoming increasingly convinced that the concepts we apply to diets on the body can be applied with some parallel applications in the world of information. </p>  <p><strong>Calorie Counting</strong></p>  <p>The first thing that applies to physical diets is the concept of tracking intake. Our bodies can utilize up to a certain amount of food after which, no matter how good it is, the food is going to be stored up as fat. Is tracking intake something that can be applied to information? The number of sites visited in a day, the number of browser tabs open, the amount of time getting pumped with information via some form of media: podcast, radio, screencast, television or otherwise? Is there a point where that additional reading does no good and takes away from what might have been retained?</p>  <p><strong>Exercise</strong></p>  <p>The second basic thing in the world of physical diets is some concomitant form of exercise. Some of this might be for burning away calories (cardio) but sometimes it’s about gaining mass or turning “fat” into “muscle.” I wonder what exercise looks like in the world of information. Steve Yegge had <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/practicing-programming">an old article</a> about practice for programmers and I suspect that exercise involves designating time specifically for the mental effort related to processing information efficiently. </p>  <blockquote>   <p style="font-size: 1.5em">“The great engineers I know are as good as they are <em>because</em> they practice all the time. People in great physical shape only get that way by working out regularly, and they need to keep it up, or they get out of shape. The same goes for programming and engineering.”</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>Media and Delivery</strong></p>  <p>There are different “food groups” associated with a healthy diet. Some types of food, like “fatty carbs” are very difficult to incorporate into any meaningful diet but others, like fruit, are a staple of most sensible dieting efforts drawn up for a healthier lifestyle. I wrote down my main sources of intake and looking at the list I would consider some blog entries analogous to fatty carbs or sugar whereas other forms of intake such as technical books to be a more substantive form of media for input and processing. </p>  <p>Confession: I’m an architecture geek<sup>1</sup>. It started in earnest when I moved to South Dakota – it was the first time I’d lived in a rural area. I missed the built environment I was used to in cities. Along the way I’ve managed to have 14 different architecture blogs in my RSS Reader. Especially since I’m not an architect, this is excessive. I usually enjoy a story here and there but I leave a lot unread. This is a case where it’s not my curiosity that needs to go away, it’s the delivery format. I’d be better served rereading Steen Eiler Rasmussen’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Experiencing-Architecture-Steen-Eiler-Rasmussen/dp/0262680025">Experiencing Architecture</a> or Bjarke Ingalls’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yes-More-Archicomic-Architectural-Evolution/dp/3836520109/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293108284&amp;sr=1-1">Yes Is More</a> than getting distracted by blog entries from the web. </p>  <p><strong>Processing</strong></p>  <p>I’m not sure there is any equivalent in the world of dieting but the last thing I’ve been thinking about related to my information diet is designating time for processing. Earlier this year I finally made some headway in understanding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> and though I can’t say I’ve implemented everything David Allen recommends two things have stuck: his recommendation of using a calendar and the idea that you process information rather than letting it idle in an indeterminate state. </p>  <p>It’s occurred to me that in recent years information access for personal and professional development is trivial. Wikipedia is a great resource for documenting general knowledge. For professional work there are websites, link aggregators, and vendors eagerly providing a glut of information to learn from. </p>  <p>In this environment, what does it mean to “process” an information resource? For example, at work this week we watched <a href="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/Default.aspx">Bart De Smet</a> give <a href="http://bit.ly/bfzKCk">a talk</a> on a language feature of C# called LINQ. I’ve used LINQ quite a bit but his talk covered some direction in the technology that is new (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/ee794896.aspx">Rx</a>). In a more general sense, he referenced the Wikipedia entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">Monads</a> – another resource which I would like to process. </p>  <p>I’m not sure what processing should look like but it seems like what it means to process an information resource is less of an issue than the discipline it takes to designate time for it. Perhaps that ties this notion back to exercise. </p>  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>  <p>I’ll be using the next couple of weeks to think more about what an Information Diet should look like and a practical structure to use. I’m posting in part because I would love any input on tactics and also because committing this to the permanence of my blog means the commitment is formalized. Four areas of focus will be: </p>  <ul>   <li>Calorie Counting – tracking input</li>    <li>Exercise – deliberate practice </li>    <li>Media and Delivery – determining which formats and timing work best for information</li>    <li>Processing – what steps are involved in making meaning out of information</li> </ul>  <h3><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h3>  <p><sup>1</sup>A running joke with my wife is that I will quit my job, enroll in an architecture program just so I can be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Goldberger">critic</a>. She takes great joy in laughing about this.</p>  </div>

If I could translate the request, it could simply be that they want things in the best possible experience for each of the disparate platforms for which they had users. Of course the smart phone was no exception. </p>  <p>In a world like this, what could the future portend but that we will have multiple platforms, no singular delivery, and a constantly increasing need to build things quickly, portably? </p>  <p>I’ve cited the article quite a bit but over the years I’ve always gone back to Jonathan Edwards <a href="http://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=79">article</a> on Beautiful Code: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>“I wish someone had instead warned me that programming is a desperate losing battle against the unconquerable complexity of code, and the treachery of requirements.”</p> </blockquote>  <p>Although Edwards was talking more specifically about code, all of my experience points towards this truth in the realms of the disparate platforms, specifically that getting something to work in a “real world” where people use different operating systems, browsers, displays, and connectivity paradigms. Over the years there have been different tactics in trying to solve the problem: <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">web standards</a>, ActiveX controls, Java, plugins, and of course the latest new craze, HTML5. It’s not that these tactics (and the technologies related to them) are bad: I still advocate web standards to a point, I still have my day job programming Silverlight. It’s just that the pragmatist in me thinks this is the Arab-Israeli conflict in software: no perfect solution no matter how badly its desired by those in each of the platform camps. </p>  <p>The big insight for me as a developer is this line:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>“<strong>This means as a developer you&#8217;ll need to expand what you know and learn more platforms. Is that bad or good?&#160; Both. It means more work for all of us, but it does mean you&#8217;ll need to less focus on silo&#8217;s of platforms and use your knowledge across these platforms.</strong>”</p> </blockquote>  <h3><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h3>  </div>

<h2>{</h2>  <p>Since my days <strong><em><a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2007/02/language-and-thinking.html">trying to hack up some Perl</a></em></strong><sup>1</sup> I was charmed by the idea of a developer’s advent calendar: a day by day lead up to Christmas with articles pertaining to a specific topic. I’m otherwise a scrooge during the holiday time; not given to commercialism, Christmas music, and other seasonal rituals. </p>  <p>But I am up for the both the <a href="http://perladvent.pm.org/2010/">Perl Advent Calendar</a> and the <a href="http://advent.rjbs.manxome.org/2010/">RJBS (Perl) Advent Calendar</a>. On a similar vein, <a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/">Sys Advent</a>, a sys admin advent calendar should be interesting tracking too.</p>  <p>Others have riffed on the idea, most notably web developers. <a href="http://24ways.org/2010">24ways</a> is a seasonal advent project that I’ve tuned into each year – I usually have at least one or two of the posts stick. </p>  <p>Finally, there is an entrepreneurial advent calendar, <a href="http://24waystostart.com/2010/">24waystostart</a>. A lot of good things in there, I feel the onset of holiday good cheer. </p>  <p>I’m disappointed not to find a .NET Advent calendar (or even a Python one!). If you know of a good advent calendar, developer or otherwise, feel free to share. A few good articles can make the season pleasurable, even for a grinch like me. </p>  <h2>}</h2>  <p><sup>1</sup>Could it have been that long ago? Funny to see those old posts, but that&#8217;s part of why I blog</p>  </div>

<h3><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h3>  <p>Although it’s been mentioned before here, it bears repeating that before you find yourself making a reference to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb410770.aspx">DataContractJsonSerializer</a>, you ought to consider and indeed are more likely better off with the NewtonSoft library <a href="http://json.codeplex.com/">Json.NET</a>. Whereas the DataContractJsonSerializer relies on giving you the flexibility of creating types and using the DataContract and DataMember attributes on them for a lot of granular control, this is burdensome with types that should naturally find themselves serializable and JSON friendly. For example, let’s say I have a Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;; the intent of the user shouldn’t be too complicated in the serialization process. Or, if I have a class Foo with a couple of properties, and I want to serialize an IEnumerable of said class, again, the intent doesn’t require the extra use of attributes and a complexity overhead. </p>  <p>This is not to say that the DataContractJsonSerializer does not have its place; if you are leveraging WCF and choosing JSON as your serialization format, it is probably the best route to go. That said, however, I have fallen more than once into a “pit of success” with Json.NET after getting burdened with trying to use the DataContractJsonSerializer.</p>  <p>Json.NET is still quite active, the last release during the latter half of this year. <a href="http://json.codeplex.com/releases/view/50552#ReviewsAnchor">Check it out</a>.</p>  <h3><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h3>  </div>
