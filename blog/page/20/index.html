Not only is the author, <a href="http://osteele.com/blog/">Oliver Steele</a>, engaging but his visualizations are exceptional. I&#8217;d like to think of myself as a &#8220;language maven&#8221; - that is a person who puts the emphasis on language capabilities before tools - but I know that growing up in the Microsoft world as I did, I understand how big of a difference good tools can be.<br /><br />One item I don&#8217;t recall seeing in the essay was how tool mavens are responsible for their own obsolesence.  It makes perfect sense to focus on language first and be flexible with tools - and to have a good text editor you can rely upon.  I started using <a href="http://www.textpad.com">Textpad</a> first with Java and nowadays I usually don&#8217;t pass a day when I don&#8217;t open something with it - either for quick inspection of a file or to write something in perl or python.<br /><br />I know there are other good text editors out there but it seems like having good regex support and the ability to attach shell commands to keyboard shortcuts is most important.  Syntax highlighting is a nicety too although as time passes it&#8217;s not really as important to me.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />Some time ago Jason Kottke posted <a href="http://www.kottke.org/04/10/normalized-data">an entry</a> for which quite a few people bashed him about unnecessary database normalization.  I&#8217;ve thought a lot about it since it represents some of my own internal sentiments and instincts.  The two things I observe on a regular basis that I find annoying are bad naming conventions within databases and unnecessary complexity because of overzealous normalization.<br /><br />It&#8217;s hard to have an <strike>argument</strike> discussion on the topic with people lacking experience because the penalties for bad normalization are usually paid in the long term whereas the &#8220;effeciency&#8221; of storage with normalized data seems to be an ideal to strive for when one&#8217;s perspective is short.<br /><br />I was therefore heartened to see <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/07/23/normalization-is-for-sissies.aspx">some caution from Patt Heland</a> (courtesy of <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/08/03/WhenNotToNormalizeYourSQLDatabase.aspx">Dare Obasanjo</a> who elaborates) on the topic.  It may be a good idea to have a meeting at work and discuss some of the details given&#8230; maybe not to come to some &#8220;conclusion&#8221; or &#8220;database standard&#8221; that can apply to every situation, but more to generate good discussion and ideas.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I was looking over Justice Gray&#8217;s post on <a href="http://graysmatter.codivation.com/HowIAmBecomingABetterDeveloperPart1OfInfinity.aspx">becoming a better developer in 6 months</a> and noticed that he had listed Freidl&#8217;s <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regex/">Mastering Regular Expressions</a> as a one week reading project.  I&#8217;ll preface my comments by admitting I am not the quickest read - unless I&#8217;m reading something I don&#8217;t particularly care about I tend to go it slow no matter what the subject matter.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />Not really thinking of connecting the dots I checked in on Jeff Freidl&#8217;s blog and digging around saw <a href="http://regex.info/blog/jfriedl-links/about/">it took him 2.5 years</a> to complete the first edition of the book.<br /><br />It strikes me as funny that there would be such a disparity in creation and consumption.  Of course I may be slow - a big part of my wanting to learn Perl was the desire to have the capacity to &#8220;think&#8221; in regular expressions - but over the last few years as I&#8217;ve gotten better and better I find it hard to think I could compensate the little projects and tools I&#8217;ve written without the pain and grit of using what I read slowly.<br /><br />But then again we can all rest assured that <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">there&#8217;s no rush</a>.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I had posted about the set operator in Python with some questions.  All that changed today when I wrote a little script to remove duplicate lines from a file. The set operator takes a list and automatically gets rid of duplicate items.  Very useful for situations like this:<br /><br /><pre style="margin: 1em 0pt; padding: 10px; background: rgb(0, 0, 0) none repeat scroll 0% 50%; overflow: auto; font-family: courier; font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(238, 238, 238); -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; width: 425px;"><br />#!/usr/bin/env python<br /><br />f = open("c:\\temp\\Original.txt")<br />f2 = open("c:\\temp\\Unique.txt", "w")<br />uniquelines = set(f.read().split("\n"))<br />f2.write("".join([line + "\n" for line in uniquelines]))<br />f2.close()<br /></pre><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

But the problem is the set operator automatically sort after removing the duplicate&#8230;What if we don&#39;t want to change the order&#8230;</div>

Hi.. I just used this one to eliminate duplicates in my file. I would like to know more about this function set. I&#39;m seriously left wondering how did such few LOC do that perfectly?! Any thoughts?</div>

Superb!<br /><br />I had a database in filemaker with 250000 records and had written a script to delete duplicates. I was looking at around 24 hours to run that in Filemaker.<br /><br />Exported it as a CSV and ran your code in Python. Took less than 3 seconds and spat out a CSV that I imported back to filemaker.<br /><br />Thank you!</div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />One of my weaknesses is that I love puzzles.  And once I&#8217;m puzzle solving, I usually dwell on the problem beyond its worth.  I recently saw a job ad - I&#8217;ll leave this post disconnected - that had a quiz associated with it.  The quiz amounts, basically, to shuffling items in an array (javascript). <br /><br />My first stab was intuitive, but I wonder if it&#8217;s the most optimal because it relies on a lot of discarded data.  In my loop generating a random order, I essentially go through an undetermined amount of times discarding results that already exist in the randomized array.  Additionally the array with random numbers is just for positioning and is probably unnecessary. <br />Here is the code:<br /><br /><pre style="font-family:courier;font-size:8pt;color: #eee;background: #000; margin: 1em 0; padding: 10px;overflow: auto; width:425px;"><br />function BuildArray(){<br /> // just builds a random array to work with<br /> var testArray = new Array();<br /> testArray.push('Test 0');<br /> testArray.push('Test 1');<br /> testArray.push('Test 2');<br /> testArray.push('Test 3');<br /> return testArray;<br />}<br /><br />function GetShiftOrder(testObject){<br /> // this is what sorts things out<br /> var upperBound = testObject.length;<br /> var newOrder = new Array();<br /> var shuffledArray = new Array();<br /> builder:<br /> while(newOrder.length < upperBound){<br />  n = parseInt(Math.random() * upperBound);<br />  for(i=0;i&lt;newOrder.length;i++){<br />   if(newOrder[i] == n){<br />    continue builder;<br />   }<br />  }<br />  newOrder.push(n);<br />  shuffledArray.push(testObject[n]);<br /> }<br /> alert(newOrder + '\n' + shuffledArray);<br />}<br /></pre><br /><br />I was thinking about this today and it may be more effecient to make a random number of passes at the array swapping pairs of items.  A shuffling cards approach may be slightly more effecient although to have meaningful swaps there would need to be a minimum number of passes - and additional complexity with making sure pairs were swapped in random pattern.<br /><br />Anyway, it was interesting and I&#8217;m always curious about more elegant solutions.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}<br /></span></div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />I pretty much broke down after TechEd.  I thought I&#8217;d be patient enough to wait for Ruby but because Python is most mature I have started to learn it, whitespaces or no.<br /><br />The first thing I did was check out Guido van Rossum&#8217;s tutorial for programmers, which was an excellent first step.  I&#8217;ve followed that up with some random programming - a lot of fun so far.<br /><br />I was wondering about the set operations in python and how that made a difference in programming since there aren&#8217;t syntactical equivalents in .NET.  Incidentally at the time I was reading The Man Who Loved Only Numbers and ran across a short description of the Sieve of Eratosthenes as a way of finding primes.  I thought it would be a good way to check out the set operations of Python.<br /><br />I wrote the following:<br /><br /><pre style="font-family:courier;font-size:8pt;color: #eee;background: #000; margin: 1em 0; padding: 10px;overflow: auto; width:425px;"><br />from System import *<br /><br />def multiples(num, thresh):<br /> multi = []<br /> for i in range(2,thresh):<br />  m = num * i<br />  if(m < thresh):<br />   multi.append(m)<br />  else:<br />   break<br /> return multi<br /><br />primeThresh = 5000<br />print DateTime.Now.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss")<br />nums = range(2,primeThresh)<br /><br />for n in nums:<br /> nums = set(nums) - set(multiples(n, primeThresh))<br /><br />print nums<br /><br />print DateTime.Now.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss")<br /></pre><br /><br />Interesting, but slow.  The way I may do something like that in C# (which also works just fine in Python) would be this, which I wrote later:<br /><br /><pre style="font-family:courier;font-size:8pt;color: #eee;background: #000; margin: 1em 0; padding: 10px;overflow: auto; width:425px;"><br />from System import *<br /><br />primeThresh = 5000<br />print DateTime.Now.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss")<br />nums = range(2,primeThresh)<br /><br />for n in nums:<br /> for m in range(2,primeThresh):<br />  try:<br />   mult = n * m<br />   if(mult > primeThresh):<br />    break<br />   nums.remove(mult)<br />  except:<br />   pass<br /><br />print nums<br /><br />print DateTime.Now.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss")<br /></pre><br /><br />It&#8217;s a lot faster than the previous approach which makes sense - doing set algebra on large sets should take a long time&#8230; but that begs the question: are those set operations dangerous (ie. so slow as to be costly).<br /><br />I&#8217;m wondering what&#8217;s &#8220;pythonic&#8221; and how a jedi would write this most effeciently.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I probably won&#8217;t be officially &#8220;tagged&#8221; but a meme is going around about what one would do in the next 6 months to become better.  Hanselman, in his podcast, spoke of a few things and the responses seem to be going up around the blogs. <br /><br />How will I be better? Most of the things people mentioned are things I already try to do: reading technical books, working on my software, looking at open source, training others&#8230; but one thing I want to do is to start posting code. <br /><br />I write a lot of code and much of it doesn&#8217;t make it here because I&#8217;m sheepish about looking foolish.  But getting better is about having courage to show my work because without that, how could it get any better? <br /><br />I&#8217;m going to start with my JAPH, a program that prints &#8220;Just Another Perl Hacker.&#8221;  It&#8217;s meant to be novel and I actually like mine since it leverages some language features that don&#8217;t exist in my mainstay, C#.  The map operation can visit each item on an array performing some opertion - in this case I&#8217;m using a regular expression on each item and grabbing alternating characters! I haven&#8217;t been writing perl for a long time so hopefully over time I can claim a better one but at least this is my own thinking at play, destined for improvement.  I did post it on usenet (a first version which had some foolish mistakes) but this is after a little bit of massage:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family: courier new;">#!/usr/bin/perl -w</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;"># David&#8217;s JAPH, volume 0.1</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">map(print(/(\w)\w/g,&#8221; &#8220;),</span><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;">qw(Jaubsctd Aenfogthhiejrk Plemrmln Hoapcqkresrt));</span></span><br /><br />The <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-japh.html">original JAPHs</a>, from Randall Schwartz, were not really about obfuscation but more about language features.  The use of map, regular expressions, and $_ in the above are what make it interesting to me.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I never mind a long drive with a podcast.  A few days ago I listened to <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=254">John Lam on Dot Net Rocks</a>.  I&#8217;ll admit that sometimes the DNR people can be annoying to me (think Richard Campbell saying over and over like it&#8217;s a joke &#8220;Managed JavaScript??&#8221;) but it was all worth it to hear some of the internal goings on with the Iron Ruby project.<br /><br />Gleaning: Iron Ruby is a ways off.  I got somewhat impatient and have been using IronPython in the meantime, but more on that later.  That&#8217;s not a small decision for me because I am of <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">the Norvig perspective</a> on learning a new language - it takes the length of time needed to think in terms of the idioms of that language, as opposed to just writing your code with different syntax and keywords (ala writing C# in Ruby).<br /><br />Gleaning: Ruby is a powerful language for creating domain specific languages.  That meme has been floating in my head for a while - listened to a good <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/index.php?post_id=195834">Software Engineering Radio podcast</a> on the topic sometime back.<br /><br />Gleaning: JLam talks a bit about how the learning curve for new languages these days revolves around the frameworks for languages - I think the idea of Ruby combined with .NET is that the .NET libraries will fill a gap that Ruby has always missed in library support.  Dangerous or brilliant?  In other words, I&#8217;m sure the open source crowd (is/will be) up in arms because this will, in their minds, dilute the community effort behind a language.  Brilliant because the Mort you know (who is probably your boss) will have a better level of confidence about using it.<br /><br />Gleaning: Iron Ruby is implemented in C# but Managed Javascript for Silverlight is a VB.NET implementation!<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
