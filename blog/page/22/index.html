<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />Catching up on my aggregator yesterday I saw that Dare had <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=36010cd1-ba00-4531-946c-da041d934e9e">posted</a> about Sun&#8217;s response to Silverlight: their own rich internet application (RIA) framework to supplant (though the politically correct answer is not that it would, it&#8217;s just a &#8220;new opportunity&#8221;) some of the Web 2.0/AJAXish things that have been popular of late.  Mary Joe Foley presents a noncommittal <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=426">analysis</a> and <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/05/09/JavaFX-Script">Sam Ruby</a> points to a few resources.<br /><br />I went to <a href="https://openjfx.dev.java.net/">Sun&#8217;s page</a> and although it seems like a real enough project the fact that it&#8217;s applet based right now (and far slower than the Silverlight <span style="font-style: italic;">beta</span> in installing) seems to point to it as an unfinished thought.  Their <a href="https://openjfx.dev.java.net/#demos">demos</a> at this point are not just slow, but rather underwhelming - compare that with the MLB demo at Silverlight and it&#8217;s quite a contrast.<br /><br />But I&#8217;m willing to assume that Sun is serious and that their technology has a lot of appeal, especially to many people who live on the &#8220;Not Microsoft&#8221; koolaid.  If that&#8217;s the case there is a three way battle going on between Adobe, Sun, and Microsoft for how RIAs will be developed. <br /><br />I wonder if it&#8217;s wise in a situation like this to hope for a clear winner; competition should hopefully produce the best technology out of each company.  Although there will doubtless be compatibility questions that come up, but because each seems to be plugin/runtime based, it seems like developers will have an opportunity to choose a target and build with/for it rather than some of the monkeying around that needs to be done to make a web application work on multiple browsers. <br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />It wasn&#8217;t until this morning that I had a chance to look at <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/">John Lam</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/">Jim Hugunin</a> present on<a href="http://sessions.visitmix.com/default.asp?event=1011&pid=XBD05&amp;disc=&id=1563&amp;year=2007&search=XBD05"> the DLR at Mix</a>.  My response is a mixture of giddiness and shock - appropriate I hope for a programming language geek like me.  Lam begins the presentation by writing a &#8220;simple&#8221; application with a mixture of C# (an onscreen button), with its click event handled in Ruby, obtaining parameters from Visual Basic and making a call to a Javascript function.  Hugunin is not to be outdone: he follows up with an animation library he has written and his own mixture of onscreen manipulation with a mix of Python, Visual Basic, Javascript, and Ruby.<br /><br />This is the part of Silverlight that I can grok as a developer of nary so flashy (pun intended) as much as practical pieces of software. The ability to put so many languages in concert, the development experience as text-based and interactive (edit text and refresh just like you do with HTML), and the cross platform support make my mind swim with potential uses.  The fact that their demonstration was on a Mac was a brash in the best sense: it&#8217;s a level of confidence that&#8217;s not based on arrogance, but preference (Lam presented on a Macbook pro at Teched last year).<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to meet John Lam at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2007/default.mspx">TechEd</a> last year (I have this problem of &#8220;freezing up&#8221; when I meet people I respect as much as that - all my questions/ability to speak vanishes) and had I the foresight I&#8217;d have asked what his thoughts are on Perl.  The dynamic languages Microsoft is supporting initially seem like smart choices and certain languages like Smalltalk  may not be popular enough for them to justify an implementation.  But Perl? I would have thought it would make the cut.  I understand that it could be a syntactically difficult language but there are features in Javascript such as handling parameters on functions that seem to be on that order of magnitude in difficulty.<br /><br />Although the Perl community is tremendous, it seems as fractured as 3rd century Rome.  But that being said it&#8217;s possible that either one of the monks or <a href="http://activestate.com/">a clever company</a> will start a project that makes it another language in the DLR family.<br /><br />Or maybe I&#8217;ll start a PerlCLR project and get hired by the b0rg. Not even in my dreams do I have skills like that &#8230;<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

Quite a few people have commented on the absence of an &#8220;IronPerl&#8221;.  As a Perl fan, this disappoints me too but it is hardly surprising given the fiasco that Perl 6 appears to have become!  No one seems to know where the language is heading any more so that might have convinced Microsoft to ignore it!  Think of all the classical VB programmers either left stranded by, or struggling with, the .NET incarnation of that old workhorse!  The situation with Perl appears a lot worse, I&#8217;m reluctant to even buy a Perl book these days in case Perl 6 does finally arrive and renders it obsolete.</div>

You can impress your friends that you &#8220;read&#8221; his book even if you&#8217;ve only heard a few ideas. A recurring theme is just how hard it is to write software - a good reminder for me since I have frequent bouts of self doubt that is unwarranted.

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I&#8217;ve previously identified perl as my &#8220;night language.&#8221; In other words, I&#8217;m hacking away at it in the off hours trying to get better. Maybe, just maybe, I will find a way to get paid for writing perl code.  As of now, however, I write C#/.NET code to put food on the table.<br /><br />As an exercise in perl, in order to demonstrate how fast it is, I wrote <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/LineCounter.txt">a small script</a> that would count the number of lines of code I was responsible for last year.  That&#8217;s an easy task; I keep all the code I am working on for a given year in the same directory.  There are a few projects that span a year&#8217;s end, but it&#8217;s okay since there&#8217;s a lot of code that is written that doesn&#8217;t make it to my directory, and there is a lot of code I write that isn&#8217;t C#, which is all I was counting in this instance.<br /><br />After a little tweaking, I had a script I felt happy enough with to point at my CODE06 directory.  I was fairly curious - the folder is about 650MB but a lot of that is binary stuff, everything from installers to compiled bits of projects.  My script - or perl, I should say - is unbelievably fast; when I changed output to a file it was able to run in less than a half minute.    The first run showed that there were ~160,000 lines of code in the directories *.cs files.<br /><br />Interesting - not an accurate estimate of things but 438 lines of code per day (160,000 / 365) and if you consider only business days (251), that&#8217;s on the order of 637.5 per day.  I can hear the Herbert song playing <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Herbert/_/Something+Isn%27t+Right"><span style="font-style: italic;">Something Isn&#8217;t Right</span></a> in my head at this point.<br /><br />I do use Visual Studio, and one of the points of interest for me was the difference in how much code I actually wrote and how much was generated.  Again back to estimating I excluded Visual Studio generated files from my project and that cut the number down to ~30,000 lines of code.<br /><br />This is very imprecise because there are some *.cs files which are generated but it still has the <span style="font-style: italic;">Something Isn&#8217;t Right</span> going in my head because a little bit of help and organization from an IDE is fine, but the cost of 84% of output being machine generated is steep.<br /><br />It&#8217;s an <a href="http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/05/cov_12feature.html">Ellen Ullman moment</a>; the realization that there are so many layers of abstraction between you and your tool - that you&#8217;re unaware of all the hiding it does for you.  It&#8217;s a reminder of a moment a while back when I was showing someone <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2006/10/commands-and-abstractions.html">how dangerous</a> letting a tool do something for you can really be.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/LineCounter.txt"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/LOC.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

It was an exercise to solve a problem I&#8217;d had as well as write something useful entirely in javascript.  I&#8217;ve added a few new features to it that will hopefully make it even more useful in future:<br /><br />1. Custom Shortcuts<br />Proper allows shortcuts for common datatypes - for int you simly type <span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;" >i_</span> and the same is true for bool (<span style="font-style: italic;">b_</span>), string (<span style="font-style: italic;">s_</span>), datetime (<span style="font-style: italic;">dt_</span>), as well as a few others.  If you have a classname that you need to build properties on, you can add your own prefix and follow that with an underscore when you&#8217;re defining your properties. You could, for example, use sq for SqlConnection.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/proper01shortCuts.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/proper01shortCuts.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />2. DebuggerStepThrough<br />More often than not properties have a simple definition that needn&#8217;t be stepped through when debugging.  A while back I started adding the System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThrough attribute to pieces of code like this - I&#8217;ve added this feature to proper with a checkbox option.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/proper01debugger.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/proper01debugger.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Future features?  Whenever I have time the following:<br />1. Ability to remove custom shortcuts gracefully<br />2. Settings and shortcuts stored in a cookie<br /><br />One final thing I&#8217;m pondering is whether to try to implement <a href="http://secretgeek.net/wscg.asp">The World&#8217;s Simplest Code Generator</a> as an exclusively javascript/ajax application.  I thought about it as a newer version of proper but I like the idea of proper being so dead simple that it doesn&#8217;t become unwieldy. Does it suck? Tell me why at <span style="font-style: italic;">proper at t3rse dot com</span>. Want to make it better? It&#8217;s all there as javscript, just send me an update and I&#8217;ll see if I can include it in a newer release.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
