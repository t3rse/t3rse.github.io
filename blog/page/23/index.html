It was an exercise to solve a problem I&#8217;d had as well as write something useful entirely in javascript.  I&#8217;ve added a few new features to it that will hopefully make it even more useful in future:<br /><br />1. Custom Shortcuts<br />Proper allows shortcuts for common datatypes - for int you simly type <span style="font-style: italic;font-family:courier new;" >i_</span> and the same is true for bool (<span style="font-style: italic;">b_</span>), string (<span style="font-style: italic;">s_</span>), datetime (<span style="font-style: italic;">dt_</span>), as well as a few others.  If you have a classname that you need to build properties on, you can add your own prefix and follow that with an underscore when you&#8217;re defining your properties. You could, for example, use sq for SqlConnection.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/proper01shortCuts.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/proper01shortCuts.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />2. DebuggerStepThrough<br />More often than not properties have a simple definition that needn&#8217;t be stepped through when debugging.  A while back I started adding the System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThrough attribute to pieces of code like this - I&#8217;ve added this feature to proper with a checkbox option.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/proper01debugger.jpg"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/proper01debugger.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Future features?  Whenever I have time the following:<br />1. Ability to remove custom shortcuts gracefully<br />2. Settings and shortcuts stored in a cookie<br /><br />One final thing I&#8217;m pondering is whether to try to implement <a href="http://secretgeek.net/wscg.asp">The World&#8217;s Simplest Code Generator</a> as an exclusively javascript/ajax application.  I thought about it as a newer version of proper but I like the idea of proper being so dead simple that it doesn&#8217;t become unwieldy. Does it suck? Tell me why at <span style="font-style: italic;">proper at t3rse dot com</span>. Want to make it better? It&#8217;s all there as javscript, just send me an update and I&#8217;ll see if I can include it in a newer release.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />I read Paul Graham&#8217;s essays out of habit these days; I loved the earlier gems concerning matters of being a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">Great Hacker</a> and even though less and less of what he says is designed for people like me, I still read them hoping for something special. Something inspirational.<br /><br />The current essay, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html">Why To Not Not Start A Startup</a>, is geared towards people considering as much.  Among Graham&#8217;s many ideals for the person starting a company, a recurring theme revolves around youth and freedom. <br /><br />I caught a bit of it earlier in the week and one comment that stuck was in reference to people like myself, who also have a family life.  I have no children yet, but even then I&#8217;m within the target zone albeit to a lesser degree.<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;What you can do, if you have a family and want to start a startup, is start a<br />consulting business you can then gradually turn into a product business.<br />Empirically the chances of pulling that off seem very small. <em><strong>You&#8217;re never going<br />to produce Google this way.</strong></em> But at least you&#8217;ll never be without an income.&#8221;</blockquote><br />The emphasis in the quote is mine because I think it struck at the heart of what bothered me - it seemed to go further than the notion of not starting a startup to what Google symbolizes in the social imagination: the <em>Next Big Thing</em>, the <em>Brilliant Idea</em>, the <em>Company After Which To Model</em>. It was the feeling a few weeks ago I got at the airport when I saw a young woman - a UCLA college student - with a Google backpack and I got a strange envy thinking &#8220;How&#8217;d she get that!?&#8221;<br /><br />The quote remained in my head and last night while I was finishing the essay, my wife was watching the TLC show <a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/whatnottowear/whatnottowear.html">What Not To Wear</a> and I began to connect the youth obsession from the show to the kind of youth obsession I recognize creeping into my own value system with the help of quotes like the above.  It&#8217;s the obsession that the good ideas - the potence as it were - is gone once a threshold of age or lifestyle is crossed. It&#8217;s not unique to programmers or &#8220;techy&#8221; people; it seems that mathematicians can be plagued with the thought that Einstein and others resemble a universal truth: the best ideas are to be had in youth and from there you live in the afterglow of them.<br /><br />I wonder about this. I grapple with the difficulty of truth generalized - I think Graham is in many ways right - and the desire to be an edge case of his statement.  Two books I read recently come to mind: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Masters-Doom-Created-Transformed-Culture/dp/0812972155/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-2634414-1651252?ie=UTF8&s=books&amp;qid=1175356864&sr=8-1">Masters of Doom</a></em>, the chronicle of the founders of Id software, and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Weaving-Web-Original-Ultimate-Destiny/dp/006251587X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-2634414-1651252?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&qid=1175356907&amp;sr=1-1">Weaving the Web</a></em>, Tim Berners-Lee&#8217;s recollection of how the web came to be.  In Masters of Doom, John Romero and John Carmack seemed to model the notion of Graham&#8217;s thinking: youthful obsession, low budget living conditions, energy and the freedom to have fun.  Tim Berners-Lee is a massive contrast - less a picture of overnight &#8220;hacking&#8221; and pizza, and more of thoughtfulness, patience, and the desire for his idea to be bigger - an idea that would prove its usefullness and universality.  I don&#8217;t remember the exact day, but on one important occasion Berners-Lee was absent, his son was born on whatever &#8220;special day&#8221; it may have been. Even though he could have monetized his work, his values seem shifted. And I find ironic the fact that the afterglow of the web is bigger than the afterglow of Doom.<br /><br />I&#8217;d be interested in discovering some older founders - people whose paths were a little more thoughtful and wise.  I&#8217;m sure there are some out there who break the age and family barriers to become successful as they&#8217;ve defined success.  Although I&#8217;m pressed to think of them in technology, elsewhere they come to mind quite easily - the company I spend most of my time at, <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=Dakt">Daktronics</a>, is just one such case.<br /><br />I still love reading Paul Graham though - one thing he&#8217;s written that I think I&#8217;ll always remember comes from his essay <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">Hackers and Painters</a> where he described the attribute of relentless:<br /><br /><blockquote><p>&#8220;This sounds like a paradox, but a great painting has to be better than it has to be. For example, when Leonardo painted the portrait of <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ginevra.html">Ginevra de Benci</a> in the National Gallery, he put a juniper bush behind her head. In it he carefully painted each individual leaf. Many painters might have thought, this is just something to put in the background to frame her head. No one will look that closely at it.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Not Leonardo. How hard he worked on part of a painting didn&#8217;t depend at all on how closely he expected anyone to look at it. He was like Michael Jordan. Relentless.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Relentlessness wins because, in the aggregate, unseen details become visible.<br />When people walk by the portrait of Ginevra de Benci,<br />their attention is often immediately arrested by it, even before they look at<br />the label and notice that it says Leonardo da Vinci. All those unseen details<br />combine to produce something that&#8217;s just stunning, like a thousand barely<br />audible voices all singing in tune.&#8221;</p></blockquote><br /><br />I can walk away, a thirty-one year old married guy or no, as relentless as I can be. I&#8217;m off to paint some leaves. (But first I have to go home and do some yardwork.)<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />Just a quick note from a late night&#8217;s coding session, something that I sort of knew but finally got fed up enough to begin implementing everywhere.  I&#8217;m working on a fairly large Windows Forms application and one library devoted to safe type conversion is filled with methods like this (yes, could&#8217;ve used <span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">Int32.TryParse</span>, I&#8217;m not the original author though&#8230; ):<br /><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">private int ToInt32(object val){</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">  int ret = 0;</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">  try{ </span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">    ret = Convert.ToInt32(val)</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">  }</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">  catch(Exception ex){</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">     // suppress</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">  }</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">  return ret;</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">}</span><br /><br />It&#8217;s nice to just attempt conversion and expect a zero for an invalid value, but it&#8217;s annoying when you&#8217;ve got a method call like:<br /><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">MyCall(SafeConvert.ToInt32(num1), SafeConvert.ToDecimal(num2));</span><br /><br />The easy, clean fix is to apply the <span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThrough</span> attribute to your method. Any calls to that method are stepped over, making your life in debug mode that much easier.<br /><br />System.Diagnostics has quite a few other debugger attributes, one of which allows you to mark code that came from a library you didn&#8217;t write (<span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">DebuggerNonUserCode</span>).  Very useful indeed, especially when you&#8217;ve got unit tests that can assert something needs never be &#8220;debugged&#8221; again.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I recently finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Practices-Microsoft/dp/0735605351/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-2569210-1553713?ie=UTF8&s=books&amp;qid=1174625698&sr=8-1">Moneyball</a>, Michael Lewis&#8217;s tale about general manager Billy Beane, the <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=oak">Oakland As</a>, and the sport of professional baseball (note: I&#8217;m African and knew nothing about baseball for a long time - but after a few years <a href="http://fantasysports.yahoo.com/">playing fantasy</a> online, I&#8217;m a major addict; it&#8217;s hard to love math and hate baseball). What&#8217;s special about the Oakland As is that as a small market team with nowhere near the financial resources of a team like the Yankees or the Red Sox, they do quite well in the major leagues - better than many of the money-rich competitors the play.  What&#8217;s special about Billy Beane is that he&#8217;s been able to buoy the As performance by picking players that would have otherwise gone unnoticed for cents on the dollar.<br /><br />Far be it from me to overextend the anecdotes of sport to something like software development but in this case I can&#8217;t help thinking that a dominant culture of the development community online is obsessed with Fizz Buzz and functional programming languages in a manner similar to the way that old baseball scouts have an infatuation with high school standouts, good looks, and the Adonis body.  I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder about what was boring and yet obvious - the decisive factor between a good programmer and a bad one that was right under our noses but we miss because we&#8217;re reading articles on the new shiny meme that is traversing the &#8220;blogosphere.&#8221;<br /><br />And then one thing came to mind&#8230; really a few weeks ago as I was reading <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/fullcolumn/column-20070301-03.html">Larry O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s column in SD Times on estimation</a> at a moment when my own lack of precision in the department had begun (and is still) eating at me.  Estimation seems so pedestrian in comparison to Haskell, editors, language foibles, language pleasures, clever interview questions, and all the other things we look at for entertainment online.  But I wonder if it isn&#8217;t more important to be able to look at a project and give a relatively realistic guess at when you&#8217;ll be finished - certainly in my case where the client is not going to notice my beautifully terse recursion inspired by Scheme under the covers, and they will become progressively discontented for each month that goes by when I&#8217;m still &#8220;working on things.&#8221; I wonder that it isn&#8217;t important enough for a guy like <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Atwood</a> to call people unfit for programming over, or a major idea that sweeps across the net.  Perhaps Agile methodologies fit into that, but more in the sense of philosophy than selection of team members and teammates.<br /><br />What confirms this even more so is Steve McConnell&#8217;s book on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Practices-Microsoft/dp/0735605351/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-2569210-1553713?ie=UTF8&s=books&amp;qid=1174625698&sr=8-1">Software Estimation</a> parked in the same spot it has been in our office over the last few years when we&#8217;ve rushed to everything (anything!) else: Fowler&#8217;s Refactoring, C# References, Object Thinking, and the list goes on.<br /><br />Estimation isn&#8217;t exclusive to other traits that good programmers seem to have; in the same way that a person who happens to keep their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_base_percentage">On Base Percentage</a> high doesn&#8217;t necessarily do this at the expense of their Fielding capabilities.   Indeed, a person who can reasonably estimate that a task will take them 50x longer than it would take others is probably in the wrong career to begin with, kind of like a baseball player who hits better than anyone else but is so phenomenally slow while making it around the bases.<br /><br />Okay, that&#8217;s all the sports and programming I have for a while&#8230;<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

Accurate estimation is critical for success in business, yet I think it has to come second to the sheer ability to program at all (which is what FizzBuzz tests) and after the ability to write bug-free code as well (one can&#8217;t even speak of hitting one&#8217;s estimated completion date if the artifact is still buggy.)<BR/>Having said that, I try hard to make accurate estimates, and when I fail, I try to figure out what went wrong.</div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br /><a href="http://derekslager.com/blog/">Derek Slager</a>, whose background sounds a lot like mine, <a href="http://derekslager.com/blog/posts/2006/12/the-case-for-emacs.ashx">makes  a case for using Emacs</a> as an editor.  It makes me think of two occasions: first, when I guffawed at James Gosling saying that his favorite IDE was Emacs, and then later on when I was teaching a .NET development class at <a href="http://my.countrywide.com/">Countrywide</a> and a person sitting the class (graduate of <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/">UPenn</a>) sneered at using Visual Studio .NET and instead opted for <a href="http://www.textpad.com/">Textpad</a> (he hadn&#8217;t used it before but still leaned towards a simple text editor and his ability with the command line). Needless to say he put everyone to shame.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />People I work with are always amused by my excessive use of &#8220;foo&#8221; in naming things while I do examples or sketch out ideas.  I was equally amused with <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=71">Hanselminutes 55</a> which I can roughly quote here:<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8230; so once you&#8217;ve got your <em>foo</em> class accepting a <em>bar</em> class<br />and more likely it&#8217;s going to be accepting a <em>IBar</em> interface&#8230; <em>foo</em> depends on <em>bar</em> which depends on <em>blah</em> and <em>yada</em> &#8230; your instantiation looks like new <em>foo</em>, new <em>bar</em> which takes new <em>yada</em>&#8230; </blockquote><br /><br />Fun stuff, but the real conversation was about <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html">Monorail</a>, a piece of the <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/">Castle Project</a>, a .NET web application framework I&#8217;ve been interested to look at for some time.  The most interesting argument for the use of Monorail/Castle was the ability to have greater and more precise test coverage than with a typical ASP.NET application using <a href="http://wtr.rubyforge.org/">Watir</a> or an equivalent technology. All the buzz about being Test Driven usually breaks down for me when I&#8217;m looking at the kind of web applications we build.  Even something like Watir is a frightening prospect on an ASP.NET page with several grids, in a masterpage, loaded with javascript - and has about 10 different &#8220;directions&#8221; that a tester could take.  Extend that to about 100 pages, many of which support different &#8220;views,&#8221; and you&#8217;ve got, well, a bit of a problem in being &#8220;Test Driven.&#8221;<br /><br />The conversants, besides Scott were <a href="http://www.netbrick.net/blog/">Aaron Jensen</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jlewalle/">Jacob Lewallen</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
