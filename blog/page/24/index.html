<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br /><a href="http://tickletux.wordpress.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/">Imran</a> observed not too long ago that one proof of the difficulty of finding &#8220;quality&#8221; developers was that he (or she) was encountering a shocking amount of failure among applicants to write code that solved even simple problems.  This was picked up for comment by <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/dont-overthink-fizzbuzz.html">Raganwald</a>, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html">Atwood</a>, and even <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YouCantTeachHeightMeasuringProgrammerCompetenceViaFizzBuzz.aspx">Hanselman</a>.<br /><br />I resisted the urge to write up a solution but after that much buzz I thought there&#8217;s got to be a catch.  So this morning, before I &#8220;clocked in&#8221; from my basement (we&#8217;re under blizzard conditions here in South Dakota), I wrote up the first thing that came to mind:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:courier new;">for (int i = 1; i &lt; 101; i++) {</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;"> Console.WriteLine((i % 3 == 0 &&amp; i % 5 == 0) ?</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">  &#8220;Fizz-Buzz&#8221;:((i %3==0)?</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">    &#8220;Fizz&#8221;:(i%5==0)?</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">       &#8220;Buzz&#8221;:i.ToString())); </span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">}</span></span><br /><br />No catches, it seems.  But after thinking about it, I thought that a lot of people I work with wouldn&#8217;t be happy with my solution to that particular problem.  It could come across as &#8220;convoluted.&#8221;<br /><br />The more I thought about it, the more I knew the more acceptable answer was:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:courier new;">// iterate given range</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">for (int i = 1; i &lt; 101; i++) </span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">{</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">string output;</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">// if the number I&#8217;m on is divisble by 3 or 5</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">if (i % 3 == 0 &&amp; i % 5 == 0)</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">{</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">  output = &#8220;Fizz-Buzz&#8221;;</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">}</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">// if it is divisible by 3 then set output to &#8220;Fizz&#8221;</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">else if (i % 3 == 0)</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">{  </span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">  output = &#8220;Fizz&#8221;;</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">}</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">// if it is divisble by 5 then set output to &#8220;Buzz&#8221;</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">else if (i % 5 == 0) {</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">  output = &#8220;Buzz&#8221;;</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">}</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">// if divisible by neither 3 or 5, output the number.</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">else</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">{</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">  output = i.ToString();</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">}</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">Console.WriteLine(output);</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;">}</span></span><br /><br />And as I think about it, there may be more to this test than just the matter of output - you may be able to get a sense of what type of thinking a person employs in solutions and how their values mesh with them.  Even if the answer is &#8220;right&#8221; it may not be <span style="font-style: italic;">right</span>.<br /><br />A while back I was feeling some angst toward my employer (when I used to live in California) and put my resume on Monster to see what I was &#8220;worth.&#8221;  The first party to express interest went under the guise of an actual company, but really they were just recruiters.  They scheduled me for a &#8220;test&#8221; at 8:30 am in downtown Los Angeles.<br /><br />At 8:30 am in downtown Los Angeles.<br /><br />Traffic and personal discomfort aside, I made it to the office where a person who was obviously non-technical gave me a (photocopied?) sheet of paper and a number two pencil to write some javascript code that manipulated the DOM and XML.<br /><br />I was a little green and was writing stuff like this:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family:courier new;">document.getElementById(&#8220;foo&#8221;).appendChild(root.createTextNode((entry == foo)?&#8221;This&#8221;:&#8221;That&#8221;)&#8230; </span></span><br /><br />You get the picture.  I wasn&#8217;t used to writing things on paper so I was erasing here and there, and because I tended towards multiple steps in one line, my lines were going across the page and I&#8217;d curve them upward so I could get it to fit.  It was pretty messy, and I&#8217;m sure the recruiter picking up the &#8220;test&#8221; wasn&#8217;t impressed with how disjointed it was.<br /><br />And I can imagine the people at the software company, if it ever made it there, looking at smudges and pencil marks and an utter lack of comments on a piece of paper which they&#8217;d never be able to verify unless they entered it by hand.  I doubt it made it that far but if it did, they might have thought the messy code was indicative of a &#8220;messy&#8221; mind that didn&#8217;t write enough comments and consolidated steps too much. It would either go into the &#8220;Not a team player&#8221; or &#8220;Quixotic&#8221; pile before it was dumped to the trash.<br /><br />In defense of myself, or if I may be bold enough to think of my ideals in this light, I keep thinking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan">Ramanujan</a>, the brilliant Indian mathematician. As an autodidact, he was not familiar with protocol and convention and the step by step approach other mathematicians used&#8230; he would skip steps by presenting formulas without rigorous proof in order to arrive to his solutions.  Of course this is an unassailable attribute if you&#8217;re as smart as a Ramanujan and a death blow if you&#8217;re not.<br /><br />Now Hanselman has <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=69">a podcast</a> on the whole thing. I&#8217;m going to check it out.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />Royal Pingdom did <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/?p=95">an analysis</a> of what &#8220;popular&#8221; sites are running beneath the hood (as easy as a query at <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/">Netcraft</a>). Royal Pingdom reveal themselves as a certain &#8220;persona&#8221; (yeah, I&#8217;ll overgeneralize for now) by their choice of sites: Technorati, Meebo, Feedburner and so on.<br /><br />It probably isn&#8217;t surprising that most of these sites run on Linux with Apache and MySQL involved somewhere on the back end.  I&#8217;m surprised (of course I&#8217;m not in the LAMP game though) to see a bit of a surge in the use of <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">Lighttpd</a> - a more lightweight serving engine than Apache.<br /><br />As a developer confined to the realm of Microsoft tools it&#8217;s a bit disappointing albeit unsurprising. What lies beneath the statistics at Royal Pingdom is something bigger and more crushing: the people that seem to be at the forefront of thinking and building the web don&#8217;t use our tools.  Our tools are the favorite of the commoditized environment of your average big company - less thinking and less innovation. <br /><br />In part I can see a chicken and egg scenario: people building startups and experimenting need a cheap platform upon which to do so. One doesn&#8217;t license Windows Server, Visual Studio, SQL Server, and so on with a poor [wo]man&#8217;s budget when comparable free tools exist.  In other words, I would assume that some market economics are behind the choice of platform.<br /><br />But if you&#8217;re a person like me in the Microsoft space, perhaps a big part of the frustration of working within an environment that lacks passion and quirky inventiveness is that the birds of a feather live in a different place and use a different technology.  Of course I work with a lot of people who are excited and innovative - and beyond my coworkers there are quite a few people  pushing the envelope with Microsoft tools.  But I&#8217;d say in general that a corporate developer has a different set of values and goals than the kind of person who would build at a startup.  As time passes I see this less on a &#8220;success&#8221; angle - most types seem to do well enough for themselves - and more of a clustering of similar people.<br /><br />The bright spark on Royal Pingdom&#8217;s list is <a href="http://www.alexaholic.com/">Alexaholic</a> built buy Ron Hornbaker which follows a pattern I&#8217;d like to follow as an ideal - that a person can use Microsoft technology (with which I&#8217;m quite familiar) and implement any good idea.  Beyond that, there is an advantage to a smaller pool of innovators - there is more room for folks like me who may not have the best ideas in the world, but who are good enough to perhaps take something from the startup/open source space and port it. <br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />A few weeks ago our client began to report errors with our Windows Forms (.NET 2.0) application when she&#8217;d retrieve certain records.  It was a strange bug that would hang the program for about 60 seconds and then crash without reporting errors.  We could reproduce it on the test machine, but in development even while pointing to the same database, everything worked. Perfectly.<br /><br />I looked in the Event Log and noticed the following error:<br /><blockquote>&#8220;Faulting application epicenter.exe, version 1.0.0.0, stamp 45df84bf faulting module kernel32.dll, version 5.2.3790.2756, stamp 44c60f39, debug? 0, fault address 0x00015e02&#8221;</blockquote>Really, really helpful stuff. And especially because this wasn&#8217;t something we could get in development, on any of our boxes, it was confusing.  Google searches weren&#8217;t giving specific answers - the error seemed to general in the realm of .NET 2.0 to make much of -<br /><br />So how do you pin something like this down? <br /><br />My approach was as follows:<br /><br />// code to load data<br />MessageBox.Show(&#8220;Loaded data&#8221;);<br />// code to display data<br />MessageBox.Show(&#8220;Displayed data&#8221;);<br /><br />Our application is not small.  The form that displays data contains 3300 lines of non-wizard generated code.  Data is loaded from a set of methods in a separate library which itself may have upwards of 3000 lines, not to mention that that library references yet more libraries*&#8230; my point here is that it&#8217;s not a small script to throw a dialog up after each line or call.<br /><br />In the end I spent about 4 hours stepping through each of the major calls via dialog messages.  I couldn&#8217;t debug since our test machine doesn&#8217;t have Visual Studio or other debugging tools on it (like all the other machines in their offices).<br /><br />Although I think we&#8217;ve done a good job breaking the logic into pieces (ie. one method for getting data, one for display that is broken into methods for customizations on each object) it was still difficult to  discover.<br /><br />And in the end, of course, it was something small and subtle: calling the <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=502255&SiteID=1">AutoColumnsResize </a>method of a DataGridView can sometimes throw exceptions - because of the recursion of the resizing combined with the paint operation of the Windows Forms application. What was probably most annoying was that it wasn&#8217;t even my code that was responsible for the hanging exception, it was the framework&#8217;s inability to recover from an internal exception. <br /><br />When I first started troubleshooting I thought I should have elaborated more on a &#8220;tracing&#8221; level in our application - we trace some exceptions but not all to the database.  But when I finally found the bug, especially because it wasn&#8217;t in the code we were responsible for writing, I doubt it would have done more than just save time.  A stack trace would probably have helped as well, if caught at the point of the exception.  But my big question is whether there are any well trodden techniques for finding and dealing with bugs like this, especially if they are in the framework and not in one&#8217;s own code. How do you deal with stuff like this, or is it always a slog for which there is not silver bullet?<br /><br />*I think the design of the application is okay (duh, I&#8217;m the one responsible) but it may sound more convoluted in that statement than it actually is.  We&#8217;ve got a DataHelper library that is covered by unit tests which does all of our data access at the database level. It runs stored procedures, deals with parameters, and so on.  One level of abstraction higher we&#8217;ve got a set of business layer objects for dealing with the entities related to our application: loans, disbursements, checks and so on.  The Windows Forms application is what we use to let the user display/enter/modify data.  We&#8217;ve got a few additional libraries for tracing, configuration, format, data validation, and Crystal Reports.  Not so bad I hope&#8230;<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

I&#8217;m in the hunt for the answer to your question Mike - I&#8217;m trying write something that tries to emulate that paint/autosize clash just for curiosity&#8217;s sake.</div>

There are no errors like unreproducable errors.  :)  <BR/><BR/>Not sure there is a silver bullet for these situations short of building everything yourself, and that is obviously overkill here considering how productive the MS tools can make you the 99.9% of the time they aren&#8217;t breaking.<BR/><BR/>Coming from the web world, there are lots more options in which libraries you use for things, and very often this decision comes down to who documents their libraries the best.  With a single-vendor system like Windows Forms it is more complicated since you either deal with it or choose a new line of work.  <BR/><BR/>Did you find out why the development systems didn&#8217;t break in the same way when looking at the same database?  That is curious.</div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">// get calling assembly settings classstring </span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">assemblyName = System.Reflection.Assembly.GetCallingAssembly().FullName;</span><br /><br />I had used the above in my previous code sample to retrieve the assembly name before obtaining settings from the config file. It works only if you are attempting to obtain configuration information from a library that is called by an *.exe. But what if you are in a library (*.dll) and you are using another library to read configuration information as I&#8217;d planned? The Assembly.GetCallingAssembly().FullName returns the name of the library, which as I mentioned before is not where the Configuration class naturally looks for settings. Using the following modification:<br /><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">// get calling assembly settings classstring<br />assemblyName = System.Reflection.Assembly.GetEntryAssembly().FullName; </span><br /><br />Ah, much better. A subtlety worth remembering: Assembly.GetCallingAssembly() returns a reference to whatever the caller, whether it&#8217;s a library or executable whereas Assembly.GetEntryAssembly() will give you the name of an executable responsible for making that first call to the framework.<br /><br />Interestingly, in an ASP.NET 2.0 application where the runtime is processing libraries directly, Assembly.GetEntryAssembly() returns a null. <br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{<br /></span><br />A while back I complained about <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2006/11/configuration-api-convoluted.html">configuration</a> within Windows Forms applications, mostly because I lacked an understanding of the API. I hacked a simple xml file together wherein I could store simple name value pairs that we&#8217;d utilize for the application and surprisingly it&#8217;s been the approach for quite some time.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been studying for the Microsoft 70-552 exam which would update my &#8220;MCAD&#8221; certification to &#8220;MCPD.&#8221; I know, I know, certification is frown upon by so many people who think I should really be reading <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/">The Little Schemer</a> to do <a href="http://dangermouse.brynmawr.edu/cs245/ycomb_jim.html">cool parlor tricks</a>. But this is a case where what I&#8217;d said earlier about certification rings true: it probes for weakness and exposes where you &#8220;fake it&#8221; with hacks without understanding the real structure and purpose of the technology. Case in point, configuration.<br /><br />In my earlier post, I&#8217;d used <span style="font-family:courier new;">Configuration.AppSettings</span> which I now know as deprecated. Instead there&#8217;s a nifty configuration/settings API one can leverage. What I&#8217;ve done here is based very heavily on Chris Sells&#8217;s Windows Forms 2.0 Programming although I took liberty to modify some of the code to make it more reusable and generic (his intent was to show basics).<br /><br />The first stop one needs to make is to add a Settings file to the project along with a reference to System.configuration (not sure why configuration is not Configuration).<br /><br /><img src="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/settingsSetup.jpg" /><br /><br />Underneath the properties node if you &#8220;edit&#8221; the settings file, it&#8217;s really a grid that allows you to enter settings with a key, datatype, scope, and value. The scope in here can be either as a user setting or an application setting - it&#8217;s also possible to write your own section handler and extend the model.<br /><br /><img src="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/settingsEntry.jpg" /><br /><br />After compiling this is converted into your app.exe.config file - the physical storage of your settings in the xml format well know to config files.<br /><br /><img src="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/settingsAppConfig.jpg" /><br /><br />The code for retrieval is still, in my own view, a little verbose but it&#8217;s easy to develop a simple accessor helper class. Even more slick in the design of the .NET Framework is that class library projects (DLLs) pull configuration settings from their hosted EXE so you the utility code here is from a DLL designed to be referenced and used from any application.<br /><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:78%;">using System;<br />using System.Collections.Generic;<br />using System.Text;<br />using System.Configuration;<br /><br />namespace SettingsGroperLib<br />{<br />public enum SettingType {<br />userSettings,<br />applicationSettings<br />}<br /><br />public class ConfHelp<br />{<br /><br />public static string GetConfSetting(SettingType settingType, string settingKey) {<br />// obtain current configuration<br />Configuration currentConfig =<br />ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(ConfigurationUserLevel.None);<br />// obtain section utilizing enumeration<br />ConfigurationSectionGroup group =<br />currentConfig.GetSectionGroup(settingType.ToString());<br />// get calling assembly settings class<br />string assemblyName = System.Reflection.Assembly.GetCallingAssembly().FullName;<br />// yah, it&#8217;s ugly, but it works<br />string friendlyName = assemblyName.Split(&#8216;,&#8217;)[0];<br />// obtain section by combining friendlyname to settings class<br />ClientSettingsSection section =<br />(ClientSettingsSection)group.Sections.Get(<br />String.Format(<br />&#8220;{0}.Properties.Settings&#8221;,<br />friendlyName<br />)<br />);<br />// get setting key<br />SettingElement element =<br />section.Settings.Get(settingKey);<br />// return settings value as<br />return element.Value.ValueXml.FirstChild.Value;<br />}<br /><br />}<br />}<br /></span><br />Sorry about the format; you can download a nice formated version <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/ConfHelp.cs.txt">here</a>.<br /><br />It all seems so easy once you take the time. I think the unlearning was a big obstacle for me since working with config files was something I did all the time in .NET 1.x and old habits die hard. Oh yeah, the retrieval:<br /><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:78%;">string test = ConfHelp.GetConfSetting(SettingType.applicationSettings, &#8220;DBUrl&#8221;);</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />Jakob Nielsen just updated his list of <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9605.html">top ten mistakes</a> a web designer can make.  I&#8217;ve got no clout like he does but my number one annoyance in web design is when people work against the browser. <br /><br />The best example of this in my mind is the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&hl=en&amp;q=Prevent+back+button">back button</a>. On so many projects I&#8217;ve had &#8220;issues&#8221; submitted related to the use of the back button and had to write code to try to cheat the browser into not allowing its use.  But the back button is there for a reason and working against the browser is almost always futile: trying to prevent using backspace, alt+arrow, right clicks, programmable mouse buttons, pasting to multiple browser sessions&#8230; at what point do we just allow users to keep their control?<br /><br />I like apps that tolerate issues related to browser control - they let you do it but when they croak, it&#8217;s an edge case that they aren&#8217;t willing to reprogram the entire system for. I wish more people would <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwodarch.pl?Feb.16.2007">grok</a> the fact that browsers simply aren&#8217;t fat clients and they&#8217;ve got to share control.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />I&#8217;m fortunate enough to be sitting in on some training and the ice breaker at the beginning was to say which language one liked the most.  Most in the room went with what they use for work, C#, but of course I had to break the flow and say I prefer Perl and Javascript in terms of raw language more than anything at the moment.<br /><br />Talking about it later I brought up the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_and_programming_languages">Sapir Whorf notion</a> of language affecting thinking and problem solving and it&#8217;s funny how you have a thought and seems to start jumping out at you all over the place. Tonight I <a href="http://www.guild.net/~schwern/papers/Why_I_Am_Not_A_Java_Programmer/why.html">ran into</a> (courtesy of <a href="http://raganwald.com/weblog/">Raganwald</a>) the following quotes regarding that idea:<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;The connection between the language in which we think/program and theproblems<br />and solutions we can imagine is very close.  For this reasonrestricting<br />language features with the intent of eliminating programmer errors is at best<br />dangerous.&#8221; - Bjarne Stroustrup</blockquote><br /><blockquote>&#8220;The very fact that it&#8217;s possible to write messy programs in Perl isalso what<br />makes it possible to write programs that are cleaner in Perlthan they could ever<br />be in a language that attempts to enforcecleanliness.  The potential for<br />greater good goes right along with thepotential for greater evil.&#8221; - Larry Wall</blockquote><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

To the degree that commercials evoke a sense of a company&#8217;s ideals, it&#8217;s telling of something I&#8217;ve always thought of when comparing Microsoft to others - they are trying to solve harder problems than the home movie or virtual greeting card. <br /><br />Of course, they could just be playing to <em>my</em> ideals and trying to make money out of it&#8230;<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
