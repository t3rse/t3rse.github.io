<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />A while back Aaron offhandedly shows me a slick trick with Firefox when I&#8217;m <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2006/10/firefox-hiding-namespaces-arg.html">complaining</a> about how it doesn&#8217;t show namespaces on xml documents: you can use view-source as a protocol to look a website&#8217;s source code.  If you&#8217;ve got Firefox, <a href="view-source:http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/">check it out</a>.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been making my way through the 5th edition of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596101996?tag=davidflanagancom&camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0596101996&adid=0R5QC4BG081S63BM6HNF&amp;">Rhino book</a> and Flanagan shows another technique of using your address bar with a protocol.  You can type something like:<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">javascript:alert(&#8220;Hello World&#8221;); </span><br /><br />into your address bar and just like that you&#8217;ve got a little play pen for your javascript.  You can also extend it to include html that you&#8217;d like to render, for example:<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">javascript:alert(&#8220;Hello There&#8221;);&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;</span><br /><br />Of course do not forget about:config as a way to configure Firefox.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />Jeff Atwood <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000771.html">posted</a> recently about certification, coming to the following conclusion:<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in certifications. The certification alphabet is no substitute<br />for a solid portfolio; you should be spending your time building stuff, not<br />studying for multiple choice tests. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re worthless,<br />either. I don&#8217;t think certifications get in the way, as long as you can<br />demonstrate an impressive body of work along with them. &#8221;</blockquote><br />Many of the comments are the predictable reactions to certifications: they suck, people who obtain them don&#8217;t know anything, they are self taught without certification, those who can&#8217;t code obtain certifications and so on.<br /><br />Reading a lot of the comments makes me want to add my own perspective to the fray, as cluttered as it is, because I&#8217;m the product of certifications. My own conclusion on certifications doesn&#8217;t fall far from Atwood&#8217;s, but because I was and am tied to that world, I reach it by a different means.<br /><br />My background is what led me to certifications. My degree was in Accounting, and the only company that took a serious look at me in the technology world as I frantically tried to leave the public accounting firm I worked at required them.  In fact, during my interview, my interviewer told me that I was one of several candidates who they were considering, and the first of us to obtain a certification would probably get the job.  I didn&#8217;t really know where to start - I had some sparse computer experience from building web pages and working in my university computer lab, but I was limited in doing practical things with computers.  I went to my neighborhood bookstore and inspected the shelves, settling upon the biggest book I could find (assuming it had the most content) to study for the Microsoft Networking Essentials exam.  I spent my lunch breaks at the accounting firm memorizing differnent network topographies, cables, and protocols.<br /><br />I failed the exam on my first try, but this was not because I missed anything in the book.  I was a fairly good student, and I literally memorized large portions of the book. Rather, I failed because I didn&#8217;t know how the test would relate to the material I had learned.  Once in the &#8220;certification game&#8221; I understood how people study for the exams (practice exams, looking at exam objectives) and how to look for &#8220;keywords&#8221; - things that give away the answer to the question.<br /><br />For that basic networking exam, relating Novel any time I saw IPX/SPX was half the hard work in finding an answer to the question. For example:<br /><br />Q. You have connected several Novel print servers to your Network but users complain that they do not work. What should you do?<br />A. Verify that IPX/SPX protocol or client is enabled.<br /><br />I never failed another certification exam. Well, alright, I failed a VB 6 Enterprise Application Development exam because I&#8217;d had a wisdom tooth pulled the day before and was under the influence of painkillers, but I&#8217;ll pretend that didn&#8217;t happen. <br /><br />As the exams got more elaborate, I learned it was very important to know how questions were asked (use practice exams) and where I was weak (exam objectives).  The exam objectives would tell you which part of a product you were weak on.  For example, I was never very good at answering deployment questions when taking developer exams.  Not only was this somewhat difficult (and boring) to simulate, it wasn&#8217;t something I needed to do very often living primarily in the world of web application development.<br /><br />Now that I&#8217;ve had some distance in the certification world, my conclusion for people - especially developers - is that people who certify are responsible for learning how to answer questions.  Although these questions may be related to their experiences, experience and knowledge are not a sure way of passing an exam. One needs to know how the questions work.  Even on exams that involve simulations, understanding what will be needed is critical. <br /><br />I certified on SQL Server many years ago - I don&#8217;t remember the exact year - but it was during the  SQL Server 7 days.  I will probably take the new SQL Server exams but much of this is based on simulations - I know this because a coworker recently passed on of the exams and told me about it.  The interesting thing is that I&#8217;ve used SQL Server every day for at least 5 years and prefer to live in TSQL for most of what I do.  I&#8217;d have to spend some time getting comfortable with the GUI in order to take this exam, but it would not be related to my experience. Even more frustrating - my time looking at the GUI would just be learning to do things I already do.<br /><br />In this sense I share the frustration that many people have about certifications: ability to answer quiz questions doesn&#8217;t translate directly into the workings of day to day development.  Many of the typical questions even if unknown would be about a 1 minute trip to Google or the documentation. <br /><br />Here is my &#8220;but:&#8221; certifications force exposure for the people taking them. I know a lot more about deployment than I would have if I based what I knew on what I was inclined to learn on the job.  I know a lot more about networking than most of the people I work with simply because I did have to learn it to be &#8220;certified.&#8221;  I&#8217;m sure some of my time without certifications would have been spent on personal projects or readings of personal interest, but without discipline some of that reading is of only general benefit.  And because certification objectives are very practical (if not boring) they usually result in knowledge that is more focused.<br /><br />I had a friend who was largely self taught and extremely intelligent. His personal study took him into the world of C++ where he excelled, preferring to spend his time studying Open GL libraries.  It&#8217;s interesting stuff, to be sure, but it&#8217;s not MFC or the Win32 API.  As a result he could make a lot of cool demos, but he wasn&#8217;t the type of person to write a banking application. He wasn&#8217;t particularly interested in that but as a thought experiment what if he&#8217;d decided to endure some of the boredome and learn how to write MFC with database connectivity?  Certification would have forced that exposure which, combined with his aptitude, would have made him quite a developer.<br /><br />One final note before I give my own conclusion - similar to Atwood&#8217;s but different enough that I felt compelled to write this.  Atwood posts a comment from <a href="http://systemsguild.com/GuildSite/TDM/certification.html">an older article </a>on certifiction:<br /><br /><blockquote> I suggest that we have a perfectly fine selection mechanism at work today;<br />it&#8217;s called the market. Some people get hired as software developers and some<br />people don&#8217;t. It is a lot more competent than any appointed elite would be and a<br />lot more ethical.</blockquote><br />I recently realized that there is a little bit more economic activity in certification, not necessarily on the side of the big companies that sponsor them.  Many people who have certification use it as a tool to restrict supply and drive up their own &#8220;value.&#8221;  For example, many Microsoft trainers are eager to have Microsoft require a &#8220;premier certification&#8221; in order to teach their coursework.  The argument they use officially is that it will ensure that the trainer delivering content is knowledgable but the intersting facet of this argument is that obtaining and maintaining &#8220;premier certifications&#8221; (many of which have multiple exams) requires considerable effort (and massive opportunity cost - instead of learning the new GUI of SQL Server 2005 a person could be writing, say, a stored procedure generator using <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sqlserver.management.smo.aspx">SMO</a>). It leads me to believe that most of them know that increasing the amount of time and effort for certification is in the interests of their pockets as much as it keeps people &#8220;knowledgeable.&#8221;  I also observe this pattern in my own certification life: when I&#8217;m doing project work, which is usually intense and requires a lot of my off hours, I&#8217;m never certifying.  When I&#8217;m between jobs, or if I&#8217;m asked to teach a class or do something that requires certification, I sit down and do what&#8217;s necessary.<br /><br />So my big conculsion?  Everyone has a story of the MCSE who never installed Windows or the &#8220;certified&#8221; guy who had no practical experience.  A lot of the time it&#8217;s people like me - not disciplined in the work of computers and trying to put something on a resume.  In that sense I don&#8217;t disagree that a certification all by itself is meaningful.  I defer to Atwood&#8217;s comments about showing work that&#8217;s been done and a track record of personal effort.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />Certifications in addition to a person&#8217;s track record are a good thing to take into consideration.  Not only do they show a person putting in some effort beyond work related requirements, it also means they&#8217;ve got some exposure (knowledge-wise) to areas of a technology outside of the context of immediate use. <br /><br />In the end my apology is biased because I do have certifications.  But there&#8217;s a value to them that most people miss because they have had bad experiences with people that abuse them or try to compensate real experience and/or projects with them.<br /><br />I&#8217;ll continue to get certifications as a part of work related requests but I&#8217;ll never get them again in the context I started with: a guy who loved computers and was trying to get a job and demonstrate to people effort and a little bit of knowledge.  As I interview people and present myself I&#8217;ll present my certifications as that original effort, not necessarily where I am now. I&#8217;ve got projects (day and night) to try to assert my credibility.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />Because I&#8217;m in C# all the time, my Java is passable with effort, but not pristine - like a Norwegian&#8217;s use of Swedish or a Portuguese person required to use Spanish. <br /><br />But there&#8217;s good reasons to hang onto that Java; it seems like <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2006/12/30/my-interview-with-google/">Google interviews</a> may require rapid prototyping in the language. <br /><br />Most algorithms are language agnostic (save the ones that leverage language features (think functional)) but it&#8217;s also interesting to see that quick deployment of those with optimizations seems to be a part of the process.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />I&#8217;m excited that next week I&#8217;ll be in Los Angeles. I got the opportunity, along with some other people from Daktronics, to attend Developmentor training on Biztalk.  Tonight I was going to watch a Biztalk presentation from TechEd but got a little sidetracked watching <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/2006/10/18/video-presentation-douglas-crockford-on-the-theory-of-the-dom/">excellent javascript presentation on the DOM</a>.<br /><br />Although the presentation is about the DOM which a lot of people think they know and understand, Crockford adds a lot of historical and insider information about how browsers work and what implications that has for writing DHTML. Really interesting.<br /><br />There&#8217;s a <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/douglas-crockford-video-advanced-javascript">different presentation</a> I was looking for - on javscript&#8217;s prototype based inheritance, but I&#8217;ll get to that on a different day.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />I&#8217;m working on <a href="http://www.t3rse.com/proper">t3rse::proper</a> to allow custom shortcuts but discovered a bug with IE 7 when using the appendChild method of an element. It will take a bit more time to nail down specifics but try the following:<br /><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">var tr = document.createElement(&#8220;tr&#8221;); <br />var tdchar = document.createElement(&#8220;td&#8221;); <br />var tdtext = document.createElement(&#8220;td&#8221;); <br />tdchar.appendChild(document.createTextNode(&#8216;foo&#8217;)); <br />tdtext.appendChild(document.createTextNode(&#8216;bar&#8217;)); <br />tr.appendChild(tdchar); <br />tr.appendChild(tdtext); <br />// you need some table with the id as testTable<br />document.getElementById(&#8220;testTable&#8221;).appendChild(tr); </span><br /><br />Pretty straight forward and does _not_ work in IE 7. Check it out in Firefox and it works like a charm.<br /><br />But the bug doesn&#8217;t seem to be that simple; if you are called appendChild on a DIV or SPAN outside the context of a table, it works fine in both browsers.<br /><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">// make a div with an id attribute of &#8216;test&#8217;</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">document.getElementById(&#8216;test&#8217;).appendChild(</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">document.createElement(&#8216;span&#8217;).appendChild(document.createTextNode(&#8216;foo&#8217;))</span><br /><span style="font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;">);</span><br /><br />I&#8217;ll dig into this a bit more - I see comments on similar things via Google search but nothing definitive. Unless <a href="http://www.cephas.net/blog">AJ</a> has answers&#8230; you always have answers&#8230;<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

In IE table row must be in &lt;TBODY&gt; tags.<br>&lt;table id=&quot;tbl_log&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;<br> &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;id&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;msg&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br> &lt;tbody id=&quot;tbl_log_bd&quot;&gt;<br> &lt;/tbody&gt;<br>&lt;/table&gt;<br><br>var t = document.getElementById(&#39;tbl_log_bd&#39;);<br>var tr, td;<br>  tr = document.createElement(&#39;tr&#39;);<br>  td = document.createElement(&#39;td&#39;);<br>  td.innerHTML = &#39;11&#39;;<br>  tr.appendChild(td);<br>  td = document.createElement(&#39;td&#39;);<br>  td.innerHTML = &#39;222&#39;;<br>  tr.appendChild(td);<br>        t.appendChild(tr);</div>

You can use something like this<br /><br />var tr = document.getElementById(&quot;testTable&quot;).insertRow(0);<br />var tdchar = tr.insertCell(0);<br />var tdtext = tr.insertCell(0);<br />tdchar.appendChild(document.createTextNode(&#39;foo&#39;));<br />tdtext.appendChild(document.createTextNode(&#39;bar&#39;));<br /><br /><br />But note that this code works very slow in Firefox. And innerHTML works very slow in IE</div>

Grrr, I feel your pain.  For me, appendChild() causes severe problems when trying to add to a node in another window (iFrame,popup, or parent).  <BR/><BR/>The only, and I mean only, recourse was using innerHTML.  <BR/><BR/>Makes me feel like I need to shower.</div>

I think the philosophy I&#8217;m shooting for is akin to the &#8220;webstandards&#8221; folks; sticking with standards will not only allow my stuff to work on multiple platforms but also encourage browser makers to stay away from things that are proprietary. That being said, I agree with you that if something is supported by the important browsers it is probably okay to use.</div>

I&#8217;m totally ignorant: what does keeping with within the W3C DOM confines gain you?<br /><br />I guess I&#8217;m not a purist: if there&#8217;s something that the majority of browsers support (ie: innerHTML), then I&#8217;m going to use it if it helps me get something done (not saying that you&#8217;re not getting anything done, just that I&#8217;m not a purist).</div>

Point #1 well taken; I thought about using innerHTML but I&#8217;ve been trying to stay on the &#8216;web standards&#8217; tip by keeping everything I do within W3C DOM confines. <br /><br />I&#8217;ve got to decide either to go for &#8216;practical&#8217; rather than being a standards zealot and take the innerHTML approach.  <br /><br />What&#8217;s your take on the &#8220;standards&#8221; stuff - these days I use DIVs + CSS a lot even when my natural instinct is to design with tables like I always have.  <br /><br />In the Javascript world I&#8217;ve been trying to ween myself of anything that isn&#8217;t cross browser, but innerHTML seems to have good support.</div>

Also, if you desperately want to use the DOM, it looks like the trick is that you have to append your row to a tbody element rather than the table element:<br /><br />http://ncyoung.com/entry/494<br /><br />I ran into a similiar problem a couple months back:<br /><br />http://cephas.net/blog/2006/05/30/cant-add-hyperlink-with-onclick-to-ie-using-dom/<br /><br />AJ</div>

Use innerHTML instead:<br /><br />t = document.getElementByID(&#8216;mytable&#8217;);<br />tContent = t.innerHTML;<br />newRow = &#8216;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;foo&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;b&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#8217;;<br />t.innerHTML = tContent + newRow;<br /><br />Plus, it should be WAY faster:<br /><br />http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/innerhtml.html<br /><br />AJ</div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />&#8230; which means in Swahili to &#8220;be excited.&#8221;  It&#8217;s interesting to me how Apple is so good at generating a buzz and feeding the frenzy of their users. My boss is using Vista right now on a brand new shiny laptop but no one is gathering around the machine to say &#8220;ooh&#8221; - but I guarantee if I had an iPhone in the cub area people would be crawling over each other to have a look.<br /><br />To be sure a lot of it is design, but there seems to be something more.  Apple seems to court their users with the new and the novel, Microsoft rolls out a new version of what you already have (operating system) or a copy of something else that&#8217;s successful (Zune).  Apple knows how to keep people guessing and drum up occasions like Macworld to wow people. Microsoft seems to release their products in a time warp (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/umpc/default.mspx">Origami</a>, anyone?) and make things that seem to have no mass appeal (Origami == <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton">Newton 1994</a>?).<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />I&#8217;m geeky enough, however, to be excited about Microsoft&#8217;s products - specifically IIS 7.<br /><br />Well, the iPhone is out of my price range (I always take the <em>free with the service</em> phones) but it&#8217;s good eye candy.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />Perhaps not war, but there seems to be an upswell in the JSON versus XML discussion. JSON as many describe much better than I do is a javascript object literal you can return directly to a page along the lines of:<br /><br />{&#8220;name&#8221;: &#8220;David Seruyange&#8221;, &#8220;age&#8221;:31, &#8220;preferredLanguages&#8221;: [&#8220;C#&#8221;,&#8221;perl&#8221;, &#8220;javascript&#8221;,&#8221;ruby&#8221;]}<br /><br />If you type a lot, you can do the same thing with an xml style of notation, something along the lines of an element person, nested element name, nested element or attribute for &#8220;David Seruyange&#8221;&#8230; the whole thing gets to be quite a bit (I&#8217;m too lazy to type it out at the moment).<br /><br />I first noticed Dare Obasanjo sniping <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=39842a17-781a-45c8-ade5-58286909226b">a bit</a>, after which I saw a few trails elsewhere - <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/12/21/JSON">the post</a> he was responding to by Tim Bray, and another referenced one from <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2007/01/03/45560.aspx">Don Box</a>. <br /><br />But it&#8217;s extended - <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2006/Dec/20/json/">Simon Willison</a> chimed in on flexibility of JSON in response to Dave Winer&#8217;s <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/12/20.html#godBlessTheReinventers">post</a> on JSON.  <a href="http://www.megginson.com/blogs/quoderat/2007/01/03/all-markup-ends-up-looking-like-xml/">Megginson</a> makes a comparison here (in the end favoring XML), and so the conversation goes.<br /><br />In terms of my own personal experience, I discovered and used JSON on my last project. It&#8217;s a very, very seductive thing but I found killer gremlins in terms of making sure I used proper characters in my object literals.  Javascript does allow you to use the \ character to escape quotes in strings but as you ship strings around you have to make sure you keep track of what you escaped - especially in my case where users would have to &#8220;see&#8221; things on screen (remove the escape) and then be able to push them to a database.<br /><br />In the end I think JSON will prevail (by this I mean more and more developers will use JSON with AJAX than web services) not only because XML is more verbose but also because parsing out nodes in an xml document is more painstaking than leveraging the power of javascript to turn a literal into an object. I&#8217;m curious to see (or discover since they are probably out there) more JSON parsers than take care of things like escaped quotes and special characters. I&#8217;m equally curious to see server controls (or encapsulated code) that can ship data structures to a client as JSON - one night project I see coming up is a library that can take an ADO.NET DataTable, for example, and convert it to a JSON string. <br /><br />Oh, one last thing. At the time of my last project when I was deciding how to proceed with Ajax, I took a long look at an early beta for Atlas. I was surprised that the JSON functionality hadn&#8217;t caught on there and it seemed to use full blown SOAP encoding web services.  This may have changed with the release candidate of ASP.NET Ajax but at the time JSON was pretty popular in the world of javascript.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

I&#8217;ve been converting ADO XML recordSet&#8217;s exposed by a 3rd party API via WDDX in our production environment for years here.

JSON was never meant to be a replacement for XML, of course.  It&#8217;s just a shortcut to use for AJAX etc. when a shortcut is all you need.<br /><br />It&#8217;s like riding a bike down to the corner store instead of an SUV.<br /><br />If nothing else, a good enough reason to be for JSON in such cases is that Dave Winer hates it.<br /><br />Hi Dave!</div>

JSON is sooo cool!! if only all web services decided to serve JSON along with XML, I can use <a href='http://www.openjsan.org/doc/y/yo/yoshida/JSONScriptRequest/0.03/lib/JSONScriptRequest.html'>JSONScriptRequest</a> to access cross domain services directly from the browser, then my server will just need to host plain static content with javaScript&#8230;mashup creation would be so damn easy!!</div>

Also, you should use a library for generating your JSON, here&#8217;s a .NET one:<br /><br />http://www.newtonsoft.com/products/json/<br /><br />I use JSON-lib (http://json-lib.sourceforge.net/) in Java and it&#8217;s way easier than having to remember escape characters, etc..</div>

I&#8217;m a big fan of JSON in the browser, not as a global replacement for XML.   One of best examples of how JSOn beats XML in the browser is the del.icio.us JSON API for including your tags on a web page. Its as simple as including (via a script tag) a link to your JSON feed and then iterating over the JavaScript array&#8230; no parsing of XML content, no XMLHTTPRequests, no asynchronous.<br /><br />For your browser, a good analogy might be reading a book&#8230; you&#8217;re sailing along reading in your native language (HTML / JavaScript) and then all of a sudden a paragraph is in Swahili (XML). Now you have to go and do a context switch to your Swahili parser, read the Swahili chapter and then switch back to your native tongue. <br /><br />Why would you ever read a book that way?<br /><br />AJ</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /></span><br />One thing that gives me delight to no end is making tools that help people around me. I guess that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a software developer. Or, I guess, that&#8217;s why I enjoy being a software developer.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve worked on a few types of code generators to date, the idea of course being to save time when people have to do repetitious or monotonous tasks. Another big idea I&#8217;ve had was inspired by <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson&#8217;s</a> talk at Carson Workshops where he talked of the notion of <a href="http://softwareengineering.vazexqi.com/files/pattern.html">convention over configuration</a> (linked here in the context of spring, but a general enough design pattern). I thought: why not start with a bunch of conventions and, if need be, customize when necessary?<br /><br />I&#8217;ve recieved two responses over the utilities I&#8217;ve written that seem to point to different philosophies regarding software development and how I win with some people and struggle with others.<br /><br />The first was a developer who was excited when I showed him <a href="http://www.t3rse.com/proper">a utility for generating property stubs</a> - a lot faster than using Visual Studio&#8217;s class designer or code snippets. I could see that it was the idea that got him going, not necessarily the implementation because his following question was if he could have the source. This is no problem on my end - I always just ask for bugs people find and features they&#8217;d want so that I can put them in an updated version. Half of the fun is finding out what people want and then giving it to them -<br /><br />The other response was from another developer who was a little bit more hostile to the notion of a utility that didn&#8217;t come from a larger party (a company like Microsoft) and wasn&#8217;t particularly interested in even seeing how the tool worked (let alone what improvements they&#8217;d want to make to it). In this particular scenario I prompted the person by asking if they were more interested in hand coding what needed to be done to which I got a quick but very sure nod.<br /><br />I think the step further that makes these two responses interesting and sidesteps the question of whether what I&#8217;ve made is really all that good is that I know these two developers well enough to know that the first is a younger guy who is interested in open source - who prefers tools like Firefox and Thunderbird, and who has <em>night projects</em> - things he does on his own because he enjoys writing software. He reads technical articles and blogs. He is a familiar and enthusiastic user of RSS and syndication tools. The second developer is a &#8220;business&#8221; guy - less of a dreamer but very much a hard worker. When Microsoft (or big company X) releases a tool he uses it, and uses it as prescribed. He rarely has &#8220;time&#8221; to browse the web for leisure or interest. He also, and I think this is interesting, is the kind of person who keeps his Windows desktop as the default.<br /><br />I think you can take these different archetypes and distribute them quite well - with varying levels of commitment, interest, and aptitude. The open source/mac/web world is full of people who are curious - who look at a problem or solution and think about how it applies to them. Moving beyond the open source &#8220;zealot&#8221; I see a lot of programmers like this - many in a non Microsoft sphere but quite a few avid Microsoft tool users. At the beginning of last year I thought of somehow trying to take ideas from the open source world and port them to the Microsoft sphere but it&#8217;s been a delight to find so many people who use Microsoft tools who are still very passionate about technology, and the large contexts of problems and solutions.<br /><br />On the other end of the sphere there are a considerable number of people who approach development without novelty, without interest in the process and more in a blue collar &#8220;just get it done&#8221; sense. Because the elegance and style are not important, it&#8217;s best to go with tools that are proven by <em>the majority</em> - personal extensions and/or hacks are a waste of time because it counts against &#8220;getting the job done.&#8221; People like this seem to have the ability to focus much more on the business or the task. That&#8217;s why tool customization, hacks, and web reading (articles, blog posts, etc&#8230;) are beside the point. The point is the task. Create a XYZ. Write a method that stores ABC. Display MNO.<br /><br />Of course with this divide I run the risk of upsetting people - especially the second developer (it&#8217;s doubtful this blog post would ever be read, and even more doubtful that the person would guess themselves) but before I reap any backlash I want to say this: both the first and second developer are pretty effective at what they do because the nature of our work is constained by the type of software we write: big business apps that essentially boil down to CRUD (CREATE / RETRIEVE / UPDATE / DELETE). I think this sort of divide would show up a lot more if we were writing a <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/">web application framework</a>, <a href="http://www.dabbledb.com/">next generation web app</a>, or <a href="http://www.spore.com/">a game</a>.<br /><br />It&#8217;s not my goal to make anyone upset although even Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nikhilk.net/Personas.aspx">got the idea</a> of different personas for developers - the question it leaves is where I can find that kind of nourishment from the first developer, even when an idea is too rough or unpolished to be useful. For people who work with Microsoft tools, without a doubt I think there&#8217;s a great community in the blogosphere but even more so at conferences - a place where a guy like me can stop a Scott Hanselman and inquire as to this or that. But beyond the conference I think it has to do with (and this is very general) &#8220;open&#8221; tools and &#8220;vendor driven&#8221; tools. The open tools seem to have a community that collaborates and grows them - people who by nature are interested in making the process of software better and more enjoyable. People who have the audacity to think that a solution for them might actually help other people who are willing to give it a shot.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

Hehe, AJ - are you sure it&#8217;s as fast?  Visual Studio .NET has &#8220;snippets&#8221; and a &#8220;class designer&#8221; but they are a bit too much overhead IMHO - the snippet forces you to create the properties one by one where the class designer has you pointing and clicking and tabbing a bit too much.  It also creates the property stubs to throw a NotImplementedException which is tedious and a lot of work to go back and redo on, say, 40 properties. The next logical step here is to write an add in for Visual Studio (for the M$ world) but I bounce around machines quite a bit and dislike having to install something everywhere.</div>

That auto generated property stubs tool is pretty cool. If you worked in Java land, you&#8217;d have had that feature in your IDE about 4 years ago.  :)<br /><br />AJ</div>

I am glad to see that at least one other person has noticed those two personality types.<br /><br />Those who are fairly free thinkers and those who feel that only the &#8220;established&#8221; companies have any right to innovate.<br /><br />It is trully amazing how someone can blast very well written software simply because it comes from an &#8220;unknown&#8221; source.</div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{ </span><br /><br />Time magazine selected &#8220;you&#8221; as person of the year with their definition of &#8220;you&#8221; encompassing people who posted user-generated content on the web. I wanted to pay tribute to all of the &#8220;you&#8221; out there who inform, motivate, and inspire me. My list is limited since I usually hit dozens of websites each week, but this is a list of the people who regularly reeled me in during the last year:<br /><br />Raganwald - <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">http://weblog.raganwald.com/</a><br />Thanks for the cut and dry honesty. Thanks for the delicious links.<br /><br />Joel Spolsky - <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/</a><br />I&#8217;m not a blue blooded programmer, educated at Yale, and you would be ashamed of how weak I am with C++ and pointers. But you give me an opportunity to learn and think about my craft. In the end I&#8217;m better for it.<br /><br />Drew McLellan - <a href="http://allinthehead.com/">http://allinthehead.com/</a><br />24 Ways. &#8216;Nuff said.<br /><br />Scott Hanselman - <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/</a><br />You not only inform, you motivate. You&#8217;re not arrogant. I can tell you&#8217;re smart because you want to share the things you discover. You never make me feel like I went to the wrong school or that my pedigree is suspect, you focus on the technology. Your excitement is contagious.<br /><br />Dare Obasanjo - <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/">http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/</a><br />You keep it real.<br /><br />John Lam - <a href="http://iunknown.com/">http://iunknown.com/</a><br />You think different and still manage to be associated with Microsoft.<br /><br />Eric Sink - <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/">http://software.ericsink.com/</a><br />Practical and smart. Open about what it&#8217;s like to be an ISV.<br /><br />Nate Koechley - <a href="http://nate.koechley.com/blog/">http://nate.koechley.com/blog/</a><br />My inside track to Yahoo! and a good resource for general web developer issues.<br /><br />Aaron Johnson - <a href="http://www.cephas.net/blog/">http://www.cephas.net/blog/</a><br />I can&#8217;t believe that at one point you were my roommate and we never talked about programming. You&#8217;re full of good stuff, I hope you never stop.<br /><br />Ted Leung - <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog">http://www.sauria.com/blog</a><br />Another of the &#8220;programmer&#8217;s programmer&#8221; people I latched onto a while back and keep visiting. I like the quality of your thoughts which refreshingly venture from programming from time to time.<br /><br />Paul Graham - <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">http://www.paulgraham.com</a><br />You&#8217;re my idealist. I usually get a sense of excitement when you post a new essay and then print it out to read over lunch or at coffee.<br /><br />Simon Willison - <a href="http://simonwillison.net/">http://simonwillison.net/</a><br />Another connection to Yahoo! and a jedi at <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2006/02/08/summit">taking notes</a>.<br /><br />Steve Yegge - <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com</a><br />Keeping it as real as Dare, from Google. Saying what a lot of people think but are scared to admit. Another person who is down the path from me, whose footsteps I&#8217;d like to follow.<br /><br />Larry O&#8217;Brien - <a href="http://www.knowing.net/">http://www.knowing.net/</a><br />Educated gentleman who kept me awake for a while trying to prove to myself that I <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,f3b9ba36-848e-43f8-9caa-232ec216192d.aspx">know my language</a> (C#). I ported my Haar transform code to Java too. Also proof that you don&#8217;t need to be in the throng of things because he&#8217;s &#8220;holding it down&#8221; in Hawaii.<br /><br />Mad Kristensen - <a href="http://www.madskristensen.dk/blog/">http://www.madskristensen.dk/blog/</a><br />Another clever Dane, but very accessible to me. Every time I hit the site I learn something new that I can almost immediately use.<br /><br />Aaron Swartz - <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/</a><br />A smart kid. I can&#8217;t concentrate through a lot of the stuff but every so often I find something darling. Maybe I should categorize this like a few I&#8217;ve mentioned above it as &#8220;good conversation&#8221; blogs or thoughts that inspire some thought.<br /><br />Sam Gentile - <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/default.aspx">http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/default.aspx</a><br />A true blue Microsoftie. Staying on top of the blog keeps me on top, usually, of what I should be paying attention to from Microsoft: service packs, new releases, and so on.<br /><br />Ian Griffiths - <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/</a><br />Chris Sells&#8217;s cohort in a recent WPF book and another good Microsoft-centric blog to keep a finger on the pulse.<br /><br />Chris Sells - <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/">http://www.sellsbrothers.com/</a><br />Another clever jedi master who cares enough to share what he knows from time to time. Author (along with Ian, above) of some pretty good books that I own. One thing Chris said from a podcast with Scott Hanselman that stayed with me toward the end of the year was (I&#8217;m paraphrasing) that the information age will show a gap between people who can absorb a lot of information and those who can&#8217;t.<br /><br />Darren Niemke - <a href="http://markitup.com/">http://markitup.com/</a><br />IM Conversation:<br />David - test<br />Darren - I read you.<br />David - got a sec for a question&#8230; ?<br />It&#8217;s a bit strange that I can have someone like Darren on my IM list to bother from time to time. I usually get emails from published authors but having one who bothers to answer questions from some guy in South Dakota is quite a priviledge. Great ideas, great blog.<br /><br />Mike Arace - <a href="http://mikeomatic.net/">http://mikeomatic.net/</a><br />Found as I searched for commentary on posts by Joel. After I&#8217;d put you in the aggregator I kept finding good stuff.<br /><br />Jason Haley - <a href="http://jasonhaley.com/blog/default.aspx">http://jasonhaley.com/blog/default.aspx</a><br />You are the future of what the Time magazine selection means; you&#8217;re a new type of curator, posting signs that people like me can follow.<br /><br />Bart De Smet - <a href="http://blog.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/default.aspx">http://blog.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/default.aspx</a><br />A programmer&#8217;s paradox. How on earth do you stay productive enough to be as relevant (which you do) and maintain enough time to communicate it? <br /><br />Reddit Kids - <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">http://www.reddit.com/</a><br />Not only user-generated content, but relevant by democracy. I&#8217;ve especially enjoyed <a href="http://joel.reddit.com">joel.reddit.com</a><br /><br />Digg - <a href="http://www.digg.com/">http://www.digg.com/</a><br />Almost as good as Reddit.<br /><br />Carl Franklin, Richard Campbell - <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/">http://www.dotnetrocks.com/</a><br />Love the podcast. I&#8217;ve got a love/hate thing going on with Carl&#8217;s opinions, but I&#8217;m amazed that you keep it going and keep it as fresh as ever.<br /><br />Josh McAdams - <a href="http://www.perlcast.com/">http://www.perlcast.com/</a><br />Love this podcast as well. You&#8217;re pretty &#8220;aw shucks&#8221; about it but honestly you&#8217;re the best interviewer of the technical podcasts I listen to regularly.<br /><br /><a href="http://voelterblog.blogspot.com/">Markus Volter</a> et. al. at Software Engineering Radio - <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">http://www.se-radio.net/</a><br />Another great podcast from which to learn.  It&#8217;s intriguing to catch the Europeanisms as well and to hear something a bit more formal. Many of the podcasts I downloaded I had to listen to multiple times, not because of different accents, but because the content was that deep.<br /><br />There are many other blogs, podcasts, and other online haunts that I gathered information (I&#8217;ll pay tribute to the non-technical ones on my other blog) but every site listed above is a place I keep going back to and appreciating. I find it amazing that none of you have to do it and yet you keep on giving to your community. That&#8217;s quite a gift.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
