<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />Usually what Joel says is treated like gold by many developers, myself included. In a <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/12/05.html">recent post</a> he berated Om Malik for <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/11/01/8392026/index.htm?postversion=2006111409">using a lego metaphor</a> in describing how easy it was for startups to create software while paying homage to Fred Brooks&#8217;s essay <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~maratb/readings/NoSilverBullet.html">No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering</a>. Joel cleverly adds context to his comments by referencing a Business Week article from the early 1990s that uses the lego analogy with the idea of object oriented programming.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve listened to Om Malik&#8217;s podcast and can tell he is no programmer - in fact, I kind of laughed at <a href="http://www.web20show.com/articles/category/podcast/page/7">a podcast</a> on instant messaging where he called file sharing in instant messaging clients unnecessary (something nearly everyone I know from a working angle uses on a daily basis).<br /><br />But what Om started was a good conversation which inspired Wesner Moise in <a href="http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/2006/12/lego_programmin.html">his rebuttal</a> to Joel asserting that Fred Brooks was as astute in his essay. Software development has advanced, Moise seems to be saying, well beyond what it was in the days of Brooks.<br /><br />The desert for this travelling conversation was <a href="http://abxy.org/a/The_evolution_of_game_programming_part_1/">this story</a> on programming Atari 2600 games. That sounds like tough work indeed.<br /><br />Well, I&#8217;m off to play with regular bullets and legos.<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">Update:</span> Some interesting <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2006/12/05/Parkinsons_Law_Eats_Silver_Bullets.aspx">comments</a> from Phil Haack on the subject.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

Hi I would like to mention another search engine for dot net developers which cover all good sites for dot net and related technologies as of August, 2008.<BR/><BR/>http://tips.developersvoice.com/devsearch<BR/><BR/>This developers search engine is inspired by searchdotnet.com and I try my best achieve even batter results. Both these developers search engines would greatly help the developer’s community.<BR/><BR/>DO test it yourself and let me know your comments.</div>

That&#8217;s astonishing. The eventual development team size was 200 with 140 people on the test team.<br />+ Quotes:<br /><blockquote>&#8220;To scale a development team, you need to establish a culture&#8221;<br />&#8220;Sloppiness is not tolerated&#8221;<br /></blockquote><br />+ By Windows 2000, the development team was 1400.

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />Joel Spolsky is so popular that I&#8217;m sure upon his <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01b.html">mention</a> of &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools">Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools</a>&#8221; - the so called &#8220;Dragon Book&#8221; - interest and sales must have shifted a little. <br /><br />In this week&#8217;s Software Development Times <a href="http://www.knowing.net">Larry O&#8217;Brien</a> clarifies with a few resources  including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Compiler-Design-D-Grune/dp/0471976970">Modern Compiler Design</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Pragmatics-Second-Michael/dp/0126339511/sr=1-1/qid=1163549254/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-8026439-9839264?ie=UTF8&s=books">Programming Language Pragmatics</a>.<br /><br />Because I&#8217;m not classically trained, I find myself with significant gaps in areas like this (compiler construction, algorithms, etc&#8230; ), so a reading list is a good thing to have. Of course, the list is the easy part and the finding of time to read and study is what is difficult.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3366ff;">{</span><br /><br />Did I ever post that unit testing is hard? <br /><br />It&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;d love to see it in action at other shops since we&#8217;ve got so much to learn.  But let&#8217;s tally the score of the moment:<br /><br />It&#8217;s about 10 minutes to midnight and I&#8217;ve been working my way through someone else&#8217;s code. This code is a piece of a separate assembly that does validation of a whole bunch of business rules before a person can process a loan application.  Each rule is fairly simple, along the lines of &#8220;if a person is not older than 18, they must have a cosigner&#8221; but there happen to be a lot of rules.  I designed the rules to be in a separate assembly because the client changes these frequently, so it will be easy to update with a new DLL instead of reinstalling the application.<br /><br />Our application is modeled as an object with a series of other objects and lists attached.  An application has a borrower. A borrower has an employment history. And so it goes - which makes for a fluid, transactional save or validation by simply passing the application object around. <br /><br />But I&#8217;m looking at a lot of validation at this late hour and finding a systemic issue.  The person who wrote the code made an assumption with respect to Lists attached to objects that makes our validation code ineffectual.  Here&#8217;s a sample:<br /><br />   25         if (targetApplication.Coborrowers.Count > 0 &&amp; targetApplication.Coborrowers[0].Citizenship == String.Empty)<br />   26         {<br />   27             result.IsValid = false;<br />   28             result.Message = &#8220;First Cosigner Citizenship is required for Approved Status.&#8221;;<br />   29         }<br />   30     }<br />   31     return result;<br /><br />See the bug?  If there are no coborrowers the rule (citizenship must be set) is never evaluated.<br /><br />But even more so, here&#8217;s the rub: I had the developer write unit tests for each and every validation rule they put out as a method.  I thought a night like tonight: midnight, fatigue, and a crapload of code to fix for a promised build, would be avoided as a result.<br /><br />The large picture here has to do with the way the unit test was designed to verify the functionality of the validation rule.  Because the problem was approached as gingerly, I think the unit tests weren&#8217;t liable to find a more subtle bug like this.  Instead, the unit test probably attempted to validate a coborrower with a citizenship, asserting true, and a coborrower without citizenship, asserting false.  No thought was given as to whether a coborrower may not exist.<br /><br />Perhaps, in programming, we need to focus more on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsification</a> in our unit tests - attempts to break the code or find ways it will assert what&#8217;s expected under the wrong conditions.  But that&#8217;s all theory right now and I&#8217;ve got a decision to make: stay up late and try to keep my word or heading to bed and fixing the code under the right conditions&#8230; the purists will say that a rushed fix is bad, especially since I didn&#8217;t write the first iteration and won&#8217;t have time to update the unit tests (I know, I know: bad).  But I have to live in a world of realisms where the pain of a broken promise is greater than the pain of a rushed, patchworked fix. Time to get the Mt. Dew out of the fridge&#8230;<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3366ff;">}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />The beauty of blogs, in particular this one: I can flaunt my ignorance on any given area.  A few nights ago I thought I&#8217;d update my current development project to have its connection string maintained in a config file so that it could be changed without a recompile in a single location.<br /><br />I knew this was the approach we&#8217;d eventually take having used it like breathing on all of my previous .NET projects (which were ASP.NET).  But Windows Forms applications are slightly different and I ran into the brick wall of not grokking the structure Microsoft uses for configuration.<br /><br />The big problem in my understanding was that I wanted to have my configuration read in a separate library, thinking I&#8217;d reuse the pattern on any future project where I wanted to do something similar.  So I created a library project and knowing a little but not enough created a config file manually to use. Knowing a little but not enough (or not updated?) I named my configuration file ConfigHelper.dll.config because this is a well known convention in .NET. I also manually copied this file to the \bin folder and even considered adding a &#8220;post build event&#8221; to the Visual Studio 2005 project to do this. And when it didn&#8217;t work and my attempts to read the config file weren&#8217;t successful, I became very frustrated and even took the time to write it up.  Luckily no one besides <a href="http://www.cephas.net/blog/">A</a> the jedi master reads this blog so my voice of ignorance got drown in the black hole that is blogger. No matter: this blog is for me, like a &#8220;captains log&#8221; to chart my experiences and thoughts.<br /><br />I realized a while back that I knew just enough from the past few years programming ASP.NET to make ignorant mistakes and convoluted work-around solutions so I&#8217;ve been reading <a href="http://www.softinsight.com/bnoyes/">Brian Noyes&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.awprofessional.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=032126892X&rl=1">Data Binding with Windows Forms 2.0</a> on <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com">Safari</a> trying to grok the whole picture as Microsoft intends it. <br /><br />So here is the skinny, as embarrasing as it is for me to explain how wrong I had it:<br /><br />1. In your project, create an App.config file.  In Visual Studio 2005 this is the &#8220;Application Configuration File&#8221; option.<br />2. Make entries as you like in the configuration file.<br />3. Compiling your application will produce a MyAssembly.exe.config or MyLibrary.dll.config file in the \bin directory.<br />4. Libraries aren&#8217;t meant to read from their own configuration files. Hence attempting to read an entry even if you&#8217;ve manually copied over your MyLibrary.dll.config file will result in an empty string once retrieved. BUT!<br />5. BUT! BUT! The library is designed to read values from the configuration file of the executable.  So if you place the following line in your library:<br />string foo = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[&#8220;bar&#8221;];<br />Your library is looking for the &#8220;bar&#8221; value in the configuration file of your application.<br /><br />To my own credit, a lot of the time when I find myself fighting with something I usually know deep down that it&#8217;s a struggle to understand what the framework designer intended and not something that is &#8220;stupid.&#8221;  In this case, what the framework designers intended is quite elegant because when you have, like us, many different libraries that all need to pull something common (connection string is probably most obvious) it can be based on the configuration of the application and managed in a single location.<br /><br />Okay, now that I got the memo, I can move on.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
