  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m one of those strange birds (is it really so strange?[1]) who loved not just learning but school itself. I’m sure a large part of this were the schools I got to go to – a small private elementary school in Nairobi with kids from all walks of life, an equally small high school in the middle of some coffee fields on the outskirts of Nairobi, and my alma mater where I made most of my life long friendships. When I hear people say they “hated school” or “couldn’t wait to be done” it makes me a bit sad… most of my memories are developing friendships, the fun of learning and lots or arguments about how to solve the worlds problems. </p>  <p><font size="4">My Grad School Sob Story</font></p>  <p>I always thought I’d go to graduate school. I would go as far as to say it was an assumption until the logistics of life made their mark on my trajectory. The first logistic was money: I had none and in fact graduated with debt that I eventually paid back. The second was immigration: even after I was able to finish paying for undergrad, as a foreign worker my immigration status was tied to an H1 visa status provided by my employer and I had to keep my job if I intended to stay legally. If I stopped working I would have had to switch back to student status and in order to do that you have to prove logistic number one: that you have money. The final part of the puzzle I lacked was direction; as an accounting graduate the most logical step would be an MBA but I was much more inclined toward math or computer science, which would require me to double up my bachelors with prerequisites. </p>  <p>I haven’t quite given up on a traditional graduate education but what would have broken inertia in my early 20s has grown exponentially and the prospect of being on the downhill side of 30, with a family and a mortgage taking on several tens of thousands of dollars in expenses seems, to put it mildly, counterintuitive although a fair assessment is probably along the lines of irresponsible.</p>  <p><font size="4">MOOCs</font></p>  <p>But not only is my story fairly common (to the extent that it is being priced out of further education), it is also leading to one of the most exciting things developing on the internet: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooc" target="_blank">Massively Open Online Course</a> (MOOC). MOOCs are online courses but unlike the websites that simply provide materials or lecture videos, the ones I’ve participated in are taught be some of the best professors and include elements of traditional course work like quizzes and assignments. Perhaps the most prominent MOOC&#160; There are three larger providers for MOOCs now online: <a href="http://www.coursera.com" target="_blank">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">Edx</a>, and <a href="http://www.udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity</a>. All of the courses are free and the affiliated universities of these programs are for the most part recognizable[2]. Because the courses are online, they are also loosely scheduled; you can take them whenever you want but there are some dates associated with courses beginning and ending as well as deadlines for assignments that need to be handed in for credit and grading. </p>  <p>I signed up for a few courses from <a href="http://www.coursera.com" target="_blank">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun" target="_blank">Principles of Functional Programming in Scala</a> taught by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky" target="_blank">Martin Odersky</a> (the language designer of Scala, professor at EPFL) and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compinvesting1" target="_blank">Computational Investing</a>, taught by <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~tucker/" target="_blank">Tucker Balch</a> of Georgia Tech. The first helps me fill the gap of not having a degree in Computer Science even though the school of hard knocks has propelled me into a career as a software engineer. The second is related to an area of growing interest, investing and quantitative finance. </p>  <p>Thus far the experience has been good. I learned that in order to get credit you need to pay attention to the dates of the offering otherwise there is no one to grade assignments. I have also been reminded that although it is lots of fun to watch videos and learn things, being held accountable by assignments is what requires the real commitment. The material is very academic and fits really well into what I was hoping; for example in Odersky’s Scala class lectures on function evaluation, recursion and currying are where I feel I fill the gap of being a software engineer without the classical CS background. Perhaps this is the difference between education and training: education is much more broad and theoretical where training is specific – I plan to write more about it at length but <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a>, whose courses I have watched and learned a lot from, focuses on more practical training for developers rather than education[3]. </p>  <p><font size="4">The Death of the University</font></p>  <p>When people talk about “the death of XYZ” I usually find myself skeptical; a bit too sensational, a bit too attention grabbing. In this case it’s sincere; I am in complete agreement with a lot of the assessments of traditional university education and how it must change. Mark Cuban recently wrote <a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2012/05/13/the-coming-meltdown-in-college-education-why-the-economy-wont-get-better-any-time-soon/" target="_blank">a blog post</a> intimating as much, comparing Higher Education to the Newspaper industry. The signs are out there for all to see – try this chart [3] which shows the costs of a university education since 1985. </p>  <p><a href="/images/CollegeCosts.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="CollegeCosts" border="0" alt="CollegeCosts" src="/images/CollegeCosts_thumb.jpg" width="410" height="329" /></a></p>  <p>If costs inflation of more than 500% are not enough, my problem of not having enough money is pretty common. But the difference between me and my American peers who went to grad school is that they got loans – lots of loans[4]. The current amount of student loan debt is approaching $1 trillion. Combine that much debt with the tremendous inflation in cost and the system is unsustainable.</p>  <p>I don’t think that MOOCs will kill off higher education, but there are a few things that we can look toward: </p>  <p>1. The rise of the autodidact who has enough discipline to stick through online courses and build a learning portfolio</p>  <p>2. The prestige of the professor, not the institution. </p>  <p>3. Innovation around the accountability and mentorship models of online learning. </p>  <p>4. Diminished interest in masters programs as the pick and choose model of further education allows people to tailor their post graduate learning toward their professional situation. </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>The development of MOOCs is pretty exciting. They represent, for me, an evolution toward that dream of further education that I always hoped I’d get. It won’t be in the hallowed halls of a prestigious institution but I will have their professors; who would have thought an African kid from Nairobi would learn Scala as a direct tutor from the likes of Martin Odersky? Beyond that, and more importantly, they make me hopeful that I will be able to help my son with his education: supplementing his formative years and perhaps changing how he goes to university. </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>[1] I don’t think it’s all that strange to be a lifelong learner. A lot of feelings of alienation come from hanging out with people who don’t value similar things.</p>  <p>[2] I used to venerate well known schools a little too much. The value of some of these schools is the amount of money they have for things like research but for getting the basics I’ve started to put a lot more emphasis on the student, not the school.</p>  <p>[3] Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, from the article <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/why-tuition-has-skyrocketed-at-state-schools/" target="_blank">Why Tuition Has Skyrocketed at State Schools</a> on NYT.</p>  <p>[4] 40% of people under 30 have outstanding student loans, and the average outstanding debt is $23,300. 10% of those owe north of $54,000 and 3% owe more than $100,000.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today while digging up an old podcast of a talk by Clayton Christensen I discovered IT Conversations will be no more as of year’s end. Doug Kaye <a href="http://www.blogarithms.com/index.php/archives/2012/09/16/cn-mission-accomplished/" target="_blank">writes</a>: </p>  <blockquote>   <p style="line-height: 180%">We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished. Much of what we’ve pioneered in the past ten years is now commonplace. Our goal was to make it easy for others to produce audio recordings of events and make them available to the world for free. That’s now the norm. We have succeeded.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Indeed they have succeeded. I wanted to just post a small homage to what IT Conversations meant to me and point to a few of my favorite talks given over the last decade. These were easy for me to find since I used to download and archive podcasts just in case. The good news, however, is that the content is going to The Internet Archive and should be there for the foreseeable future. </p>  <p>IT Conversations always represented the ability for me to reach out and connect to the better and brightest minds out there who were thinking about innovation and technology. This became all the more valuable after I relocated to South Dakota where I didn’t have a network of geek friends to feed off of and find inspiration. Even now, amongst the noises of the internet and information tsunami of social media, I can easily displace that sort of lonely feeling of working in isolation by finding a good podcast and making a virtual friendship. Even though their work is considered done I’ll still return to old favorites and enjoy the tell. With that said, here are just a few of the memorable talks over the years for me: </p>  <p><font size="4">Clayton Christensen: </font><a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail135.html#" target="_blank"><font size="4">Capturing the Upside</font></a><font size="4"> – March 17, 2004</font></p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_M._Christensen" target="_blank">Clayton Christensen</a> is a professor at the Harvard Business School.

These last lead lives, perform acts and entertain ideas that are centrifugal rather than centripetal; their thought is scattered or diffused, moving on many levels, seizing upon the essence of a vast variety of experiences and objects for what they are in themselves, without, consciously or unconsciously, seeking to fit them into, or exclude them from, any one unchanging, all-embracing, sometimes self contradictory and incomplete, at times fanatical, unitary inner vision. – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox" target="_blank">Isaiah Berlin</a></p> </blockquote> <iframe style="margin: 10px; width: 120px; float: left; height: 240px" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=t3rse-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=B008DGRG28" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>  <p>   <br />After just watching, and deeply enjoying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008DGRG28/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008DGRG28&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=t3rse-20">Indie Game The Movie</a><img style="border-bottom-style: none !important; margin: 0px; border-left-style: none !important; border-top-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=t3rse-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B008DGRG28" width="1" height="1" /> it occurred to me that a primary difference between game developers and those of us writing enterprise or business software is that in order to be a game developer it seems you have to be one of Isaiah Berlin’s hedgehogs. You have to focus in a vision and hold to it, work at it, live and breathe it, for years at a time. While the rest of us fritter to this and that new shiny thing (Functional! MVC!

It’s interesting that our history of knowledge seems to get catapulted every few generations by individuals (Euclid, Archimedes, … Newton).

Make an estimate or a result. It doesn’t have to be too accurate – the example I saw starts with 1. </p>  <p>2. Verify your result. If it is not accurate, compute the average of&#160; your estimate plus the quotient of the number and the estimate. </p>  <p>3.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve always admired Tim O’Reilly, first as a fan of anything O’Reilly in the world of technical publishing[1] but later on as I became exposed to his writing on the <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/" target="_blank">O’Reilly sites</a> and elsewhere. </p>  <p>Last week he posted an essay called <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121112204533-16553-value-creation-vs-value-capture-musings-on-the-new-economy?trk=eml-mktg-condig-118-p1" target="_blank">Value Creation vs. Value Capture: Musings on the New Economy</a>. Although you should read the full length in order to understand his perspective perhaps a short summary is his contrast of the difference between those who focus on <em>creating value</em>, using basic research and open source as examples, and those who focus on <em>capturing value</em> using “Wall Street” and Patent Trolls as representative. </p>  <p>Tim Berners-Lee[2], the man behind much of what we understand as “the web” today, created value with his tinkerer’s instinct and problem solving; not a desire to sell the next great product. His example is more representative than isolated – our big innovations (read: <strong>value creation</strong>) tend to come from basic research, and tinkerers alike. </p>  <p>A foil to what we see with Berners-Lee is the case of <a href="http://www.surfcast.com/" target="_blank">SurfCast</a> – a company which shipped no products but is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/10/patent-troll-claims-it-invented-the-windows-8-and-windows-phone-tiles/" target="_blank">attempting to sue Microsoft</a> (read: <strong>value capture</strong>) for copying their concept of live tiles in Windows 8. They and many similar companies have become adept at capturing value in a way that is completely disconnected from value creation. </p>  <p>If you’ve got the time, he presents a similar perspective in this interview: </p>  <div><iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vq63Wt5qjHU" frameborder="0" width="560" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>  <p>   <br /><font size="3"><strong>       <br />Opinion</strong></font></p>  <p>It seems as though <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_didn't_build_that" target="_blank">recent politic discourse</a> has conflated Value Capture and Value Creation as one and the same but I agree with how O’Reilly characterized their differences. I also lament the fact that recent political dynamics have caused a lot of people to look down on the public funding and incentives for Value Creation. When we cut budgets for the type of research being done at Fermilab[3], or when we decide NASA is no longer important, we lose the types of places that foster the mixture of science, problem solving, and creativity that deliver immeasurable value to the economy. It makes me sad, especially when most of those moves are just political posturing as “deficit hawks.” </p>  <p>There may be a soft divergence in my views when it comes to Value Capture – I’m not against it and I’d even go further to say that Value Capture and Value Creation have the potential under the right circumstance of a self perpetuating symbiosis. The web that Tim Berners-Lee started off with was catapulted forward by commercial efforts (insert lots of tech/internet companies here) and now those companies are driving the demand for research and new technology (e.g. Big Data) efforts in academic and research settings. </p>  <p>Some of my own concrete ideas about recognizing and incentivizing Value Creation: </p>  <ul>   <li>Heavy investment in basic research, especially but not limited to science, engineering, and technology. </li>    <li>Public / Private partnerships that allow theoretical research to move into the private sector for commoditization. One example is making public research available and free as quickly as possible to those in the private sector. </li>    <li>Commitment to education both at lower levels but also in research universities. </li>    <li>Shaping intellectual property rights to prevent patent abuse </li>    <li>Encouraging immigration for people with basic and advanced degrees, expand the H1 program (worker visas) </li> </ul>  <p><font size="3"><strong>Microsoft and Value Creation</strong></font></p>  <p>One thing I’ve been really happy to see in the last few years is a strong commitment from Microsoft to Value Creation as they have begun to release more and more of their development platforms as open source. I’m sure there are many people to attribute but I’m especially happy to know of some of the people who are working hard to keep what they build free and open to the involvement of a larger community. The efforts of these folks cannot be overstated both in the sense of how they must have to fight a pretty entrenched bureaucracy of intellectual property lawyers internal to the organization and also work at galvanizing the broader community that tends to be lethargic (I include myself here) to participate in the development efforts by contributing changes and providing feedback. </p>  <p><font size="3"><strong>My Goal</strong></font></p>  <p>It doesn’t take much for a guy sitting by himself in a basement in the Dakota territory to feel small. Although my goal is one day to develop commercial software of my own design and intent, sometimes it feels as far away from me as the city of Los Angeles. But beyond developing software my hope is to live in the happy medium of both creating value and capturing it. </p>  <p>[1] I have loved O’Reilly books since my early days in the computing field. Especially for those of us who don’t have a classical education in computer science, these books spanned the gap over and over. I’m glad to say that I’ve purchased every edition of some books like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805527/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596805527&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=t3rse-20">JavaScript: The Definitive Guide: Activate Your Web Pages (Definitive Guides)</a><img style="border-bottom-style: none !important; margin: 0px; border-left-style: none !important; border-top-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=t3rse-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596805527" width="1" height="1" /> .</p>  <p>[2] I recommend his memoir: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006251587X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=006251587X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=t3rse-20">Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web</a><img style="border-bottom-style: none !important; margin: 0px; border-left-style: none !important; border-top-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=t3rse-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=006251587X" width="1" height="1" /></p>  <p>[3] For example, read about shutting down Tevatron <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2011/09/29/tevatron-collider-set-to-shut-down-for-good-on-friday/" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=rhic-jlab-frib-budget-cuts" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Saturday I had the great privilege of gathering with other developers and enthusiasts in the area for <a href="http://southdakotacodecamp.net/" target="_blank">Code Camp</a>; a series of sessions and information sharing for area peers. Once upon a time I used to get to conferences fairly often but the mixture of life married with children as well as the availability of content online has made that type of event rare. Here is a brief recap of the sessions I attended from my notes. </p>  <p><strong><font size="3">XNA: An Introduction</font></strong></p>  <p>Presenter: <a href="http://southdakotacodecamp.net/speakers/alex-stommes,12/" target="_blank">Alex Stommes</a></p>  <p>I was on the fence about choosing this or a NHibernate vs Entity Framework talk but chose this since it’s outside of my realm. My software development life has been focuses on enterprise desktop applications or web development; I’ve never been exposed to game development other than a few articles or attempts to build things on my own. What I have built has been more of a puzzle or conceptual model rather than a true game with graphics and user interaction. </p>  <p>Although XNA is yet another framework Microsoft seems to have lost interest in, the presenter recommended it both as a way to get up and running quickly and also because <a href="http://monogame.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">MonoGame</a>, which is a direct port of XNA is alive and well. </p>  <p>XNA is a game development framework that targets a managed game runtime. You can build applications by installing a Visual Studio extension (none available yet for Visual Studio 2012). There are a lot of successful games out there and the Xbox Live Arcade is a monetization opportunity for developers using XNA. </p>  <p>What I found most interesting was the structure of games: the boilerplate code in XNA projects and how game code was structured. We spent a few minutes looking at this toward the end of the session. I had once tried to write a game in Silverlight and was deterred by a person saying I was going about things wrongly by using a game loop but this confirmed my sense of how games should be built. I wish I hadn’t given up that effort. </p>  <p>I have a goal of sketching something out with XNA or Monogame, if only to have some experience at building games first hand. Even though I’m content with my current trajectory as a web developer it’s good to see the universe in a different light from time to time. </p>  <p><font size="3"><strong>Data Programming in Visual Studio 2012</strong></font></p>  <p>Presenter: <a href="http://southdakotacodecamp.net/speakers/chris-ortman,6/" target="_blank">Chris Ortman</a></p>  <p>This session covered improvements made in Visual Studio 2012 Data Tools. It looks like Microsoft has not only ported a lot of what I used to see in Redgate’s toolbox, they’ve extended the functionality with some nifty sql command/macro tools and schema versioning tools. </p>  <p>Visual Studio 2012 also introduces a concept of “LocalDB” – a local instance of sql server that is on demand and doesn’t need to run as a service. </p>  <p>All the information was great – even though I’m a pretty old school guy (ie. old dog, old tricks) and don’t have many qualms with using sql server express. I also find myself wary of the tool driven approach for large databases. What works in my home project tends to break on a multi gigabyte legacy database or something that has a complex schema. </p>  <p><font size="3"><strong>Introduction to NServiceBus</strong></font></p>  <p>Presenter: <a href="http://southdakotacodecamp.net/speakers/joe-ratzloff,17/" target="_blank">Joe Ratzloff</a></p>  <p>An excellent talk on NService Bus from the ground up. The presenter started with some basic ideas about integration before getting into messaging architecture and how to use NServiceBus. </p>  <p>My background with this sort of problem came a few years ago when I worked on a Biztalk project. A lot of money was put into the server infrastructure, licensing, and training but little became of it… at least while I was involved. Biztalk always gave me a sense that it was such a large hammer – kind of like a SharePoint for integration when what we were looking for was something smaller, cleaner, with less cruft. We were looking for NServiceBus. </p>  <p>NServiceBus implements a bus style architecture, allowing you to create a collection of endpoints with a set of libraries and some minimal infrastructure. It is built on the aging MSMQ. There are a lot of sample applications in the SDK and the presenter walked us through a few of them – basic messaging, request-response, and pub/sub. </p>  <p><font size="3"><strong>Why Data Science is something you should care about</strong></font></p>  <p>Presenter: <a href="http://datascience101.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Ryan Swanstrom</a></p>  <p>I kind of wished this talk had been about means toward an education because the presenter spent a lot of time contrasting different approaches to learning: traditional university, corporate education, and something new: MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). By far my best take away was this introduction to MOOCs which touch on a theme of pursuing an education with modest means (both in finances and time) such as mine. I’ll leave it for another blog post but <a href="http://www.coursera.org" target="_blank">Coursera</a>, <a href="http://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a>, and <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">Edx</a> represent some great opportunities for those willing to give some sweat equity. </p>  <p><font size="3"><strong>Esoteric Languages</strong></font></p>  <p>Presenter: <a href="http://www.jasonbock.net/JB/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Jason Bock</a> </p>  <p>Or perhaps the title should have been “languages to drive the sane to insanity.” Our out of towner for this special talk was Jason Bock. He walked us through languages that not only require mental gymnastics but that also take a break from being useful. Let me restate that last part for emphasis: these were languages with <strong>limited to no practical value</strong>. </p>  <p>Here is the list of languages Bock covered with dubious practical value: </p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/whenever.html" target="_blank">Whenever</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTERCAL" target="_blank">Intercal</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Insomnia" target="_blank">Insomnia</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank">Brainf**k</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge" target="_blank">Malboge</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE" target="_blank">LOLCODE</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge" target="_blank">Befunge</a> </li> </ul>  <p>Each is quirky and nuanced, with a personality of its own. Some are all about humor (Intercal, LOLCode). Some are just syntactical puzzles. Here’s something to blow your mind: 99 bottles of beer on the wall in Whenever: </p>  <div class="code">   <pre class="brush: csharp">1 defer (4 || N(1)&lt;N(2) &amp;&amp; N(2)&lt;N(3)) print(N(1)+&quot; bottles of beer on the wall, &quot;+N(1)+&quot; bottles of beer,&quot;);
2 defer (4 || N(1)==N(2)) print(&quot;Take one down and pass it around,&quot;);
3 defer (4 || N(2)==N(3)) print(N(1)+&quot; bottles of beer on the wall.&quot;);
4 1#98,2#98,3#98;</pre>
</div>

<p>
  <br />I won’t even try to explain it though it suffices to say that I won’t expect anyone to be writing production code in it. I’d rather stick with: </p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="brush: csharp">Enumerable.Range(1, 99).Reverse().ToList().ForEach(n =&gt; {
        var singsong = &quot;{0} bottle{1} of beer on the wall, {0} bottle{1} of beer. Take one down pass it around... &quot; 
                    + &quot;{2} bottles of beer on the wall&quot;;
        Console.WriteLine(
            n &gt; 1 ? 
                String.Format(singsong,n, &quot;s&quot;, n - 1) :
                String.Format(singsong.Substring(0, singsong.IndexOf(&quot;{2}&quot;)) + &quot; No more bottles!&quot;, n, &quot;&quot;)                            
        );
});
  </pre>
</div>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Bock had a larger message though and he was very clear about it from the beginning: that exploration and experimentation are the stuff that helps us get better. Inspired by the oddities of Befunge he wrote <a href="http://ironbefunge.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">IronBefunge</a>, an open source implementation of the Befunge Interpreter for .NET. </p>

<p>On a completely different note, I realized just now that Bock is the author of <a href="http://www.manning.com/hazzard/" target="_blank">Metaprogramming in .NET</a>, something that has been on my reading list for a short while. I wish I’d had a chance to thank him for writing it in person. </p>

<p>Code Camp was great – well worth the time and scant effort of being less than 5 miles from my house. I regret not being able to be in all the talks at once, but I’ll be hard at work to retain the things I was exposed to… even the esoteric languages. </p>

<p>And usage: </p>

<p>
  <br />I will reiterate from my previous post: this sketch is just about the technique. For large amounts of data you&#8217;d be better off chunking the data out. You could also abstract the method a bit to deal with different kinds of output (string, file, etc) by just accepting or returning a stream. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If I had a nickel for every time I had to export data in CSV format… I would be pretty poor since as often as it does happen it is my fulltime job to get it done.

  <br />Some final things to note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are a lot of tools for this sort of thing, use them if you’re not addressing things programmatically. </li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="http://www.t3rse.com/post/2012/10/31/TypeScript-Up-and-Running.aspx" target="_blank">my previous post</a> I gave an overview of TypeScript from my perspective and my premise for kicking the tires: to avoid emotion and quick judgement in order to see what the language is really about. I walked through my setup in Visual Studio and how I use a post build event to have the TypeScript compiler generate my JavaScript. </p>  <p>I had originally wanted to do it in a single post but thought it would be better to separate more of the TypeScript code I wrote to get a feel for the language. The mini-project I worked on was inspired by <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/please-design-deck-of-cards-in-java.html" target="_blank">an old Raganwald interview question</a> on modeling a deck of playing cards within an object oriented language. As I got into this more and more I realized just how much fun and tweaking I could do with my approach so I just drew a line in the sand once I’d gotten the concept of a playable deck with players completed. </p>  <p><strong><font size="3">Interfaces</font></strong></p>  <p>Let’s start with the basic notion of a card. TypeScript supports interfaces which allow us to define a contract for what things we expect to find on a card: </p>  <div class="code">   <pre class="brush: csharp">interface ICard{
    isFace():bool;
    getValue():number;
    getSuite():string;    
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
  <br />The definitions fall into a method():type syntactical format. Our card will tell us if it’s a “face card,” return a numeric value representing how much it is worth and can tell us what suite it is in. </p>

<p><strong><font size="3">Enumerations</font></strong></p>

<p>TypeScript supports enumerations but even better than that we can use idioms that exist in JavaScript to get a lot of mileage out of classes that contain definitions of constants. I wish this was a result of my own brilliant thinking but there’s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12687793/how-to-create-enum-like-type-in-typescript" target="_blank">a StackOverflow question</a> from which I took inspiration.&#160; I’ll get to that later but first here are my constants for face cards and suites, wrapped in respective class definitions: </p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="brush: csharp">class FaceCardTypes { 
    JACK: number = 11;
    QUEEN: number = 12;
    KING: number = 13;
    ACE: number = 1;
}

class Suites { 
    SPADES: number = 1; 
    HEARTS: number = 2;
    DIAMONDS: number = 3;
    CLUBS: number = 4;
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
  <br />The members are defined with the NAME:type = value syntax. Again, this is static typing. It’s a raison d&#8217;être of TypeScript and it won’t take us long to see just how useful it is. </p>

<p><strong><font size="3">Class Definitions: Constructors and Inheritance</font></strong></p>

<p>If you know C# then TypeScript is for the most part a breeze. There is slight variation of syntax but once you get used to it, it fits well into the your comfort zone. Here I define a Card class, implementing my previously defined interface </p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="brush: csharp">// implement the ICard Interface
class Card implements ICard{
    private _value: number;
    private _suite: string;
    private _isFace: bool;

    // constructor with suffixes specifying type
    constructor(suite: string, value: number, isFace: bool){
        this._suite = suite;
        this._value = value;    
        this._isFace = isFace;
    }

    // must implement via interface
    public getValue(){
        return this._value;
    }

    // must implement via interface
    public getSuite(){
        return this._suite;
    }

    // must implement via interface
    public isFace(){ return this._isFace; }

    public asString() { 
        return this.getValue() + &quot; of &quot; + this.getSuite();
    }
}

// Inheriting the Card definition with extends 
class FaceCard extends Card{  
    private _faceType: string;
    constructor(faceType: string, suite: string, value: number){
        super(suite, value, true);
        this._faceType = faceType;
    }

    // override 
    public isFace() { return true; }

    // override
    public asString() { 
        return this._faceType + &quot; &quot; + super.getValue();
    }
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
  <br /><strong><font size="3">JavaScript Idioms</font></strong></p>

<p>Even though TypeScript is it’s own beast you still have access to many of the idioms you might use with plain JavaScript. Earlier I defined the FaceType and Suite data structures in classes rather than in an enumeration. Here is why: I can use the for… in idiom of JavaScript to iterate over the properties of my types and take advantage of how JavaScript objects can be treated as property bags. To demonstrate this, look at my Deck class – in the constructor I am iterating through the different card suites using a for.. in, pushing the string definition of the suite into my card definitions. I’m doing something similar with the face cards. </p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="brush: csharp">class Deck { 
    public Cards: Card[];

    constructor () { 
        this.Cards = [];
        // for in, lets me get the string &quot;SPADES&quot;, &quot;CLUBS&quot; etc
        for (var suite in new Suites()) {
            for (var i = 1; i &lt; 11; i++) {
                this.Cards.push(new Card(suite, i, false));
            }
            var faceCardLookup = new FaceCardTypes();
            // for.. in, lets me get each facecard type &quot;JACK&quot;, &quot;QUEEN&quot; but also look up 
            // it's numerical value like a property bag with faceCardLookup[face]
            for (var face in new FaceCardTypes()) { 
                this.Cards.push(new FaceCard(face, suite, faceCardLookup[face]));
            }
        }    
    }
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
  <br /><strong><font size="3">Ambient Declarations</font></strong></p>

<p>JavaScript is rife with libraries. The king of all libraries is jQuery but there are many other useful ones. In our model of card games we are going to define a class for players, giving a player the ability to have cards, shuffle the deck, pluck cards from the deck and deal to other players. </p>

<p>Writing a shuffle algorithm is not hard. Writing a good shuffle algorithm… well that is a bit more tricky. Rather than implementing the shuffle ourselves, let’s take advantage of a library called <a href="http://underscorejs.org/" target="_blank">underscore.js</a> since beyond having shuffling built in it incorporates many other utility methods for collections that we will find useful. Using underscore.js with TypeScript is trivial. First download and reference underscore.js in your project. After that you simply need to download the ambient declarations (courtesy of a kind soul named alvivi on Github) and reference them in your TypeScript file with the following syntax: </p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="brush: csharp">/// &lt;reference path=&quot;underscore.browser.d.ts&quot; /&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>
  <br />Now that there is a reference to underscore, you can take advantage of it in your TypeScript code. In my Player class I use _.shuffle, _.take, _.any, _.each, and _.reject. You can look up the definition of those methods on the underscore.js page which does a good job of documenting each one with some example code. </p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="brush: csharp">class Player { 
    public name: string;
    public hand: Card[];

    constructor (n:string) { 
        this.hand = [];
        this.name = n;
        
    }

    Shuffle(deck: Deck) { 
        return _.shuffle(deck);
    }

    PluckCards(deck: Deck, count: number) { 
        // just deal yourself some cards
        this.Deal(this, count, deck);
    }

    Deal(player: Player, cardCount: number, deck: Deck) { 
        // take out some cards
        var hand = _.take(deck.Cards, cardCount);

        // filter them out of the deck
        deck.Cards = _.reject(deck.Cards, function (card) { 
            return _.any(hand, function (handCard) { 
                return card == handCard;
            });
        });

        // push them into a player's hand
        _.each(hand, function (card) { player.hand.push(card); });
    }

    ShowHand() { 
        console.log(&quot;*****&quot; + this.name + &quot;*********&quot;);
        _.each(this.hand, function (card) { 
            console.log(card.asString());
        });
        console.log(&quot;**************&quot;);
    }
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
  <br /><strong><font size="3">Functions First Class, Static Members</font></strong></p>

<p>I really like functional programming – there are certain types of problems that lend themselves so well to this paradigm over others, like standard imperative object oriented techniques. One of the big strengths of JavaScript is that it embraces the functional paradigm and lets you use functions as first class citizens. In the card game, I try to show the kind of power inherent in this style by making a Game class that is adaptable to different types of games that may have different rules, strategies, and methodologies of picking winners. Rather than defining a class for every possible game that can be played, our Game class has two methods: PlayRound, and HasWinner, that use a function parameter to delay the approach to each so that it can vary by game. For example, you may use the first round of a game to allow each player to pick up a certain number of cards. After that you may have different game mechanics for each turn. Similarly games may calculate winners in different ways: a game where you try to have the fewest cards or a game where the value of your cards is most important. </p>

<p>One final piece of TypeScript that is used is the static member. In our Game class the Start method is static factory method that returns a new instance of Game based on the players. But enough overview, here is the code: </p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="brush: csharp">class Game { 
    public players: Player[]; 
    public drawPile: Deck;
    public dealer: Player;

    constructor (players: Player[], deck: Deck) { 
        this.players = players;
        this.drawPile = deck;
    }
    // PlayRound takes a function that defines the strategy 
    // for each player on their turn
    PlayRound(turnStrategy: (player: Player, deck: Deck) =&gt;{ }) {
        var deck = this.drawPile;
        _.each(this.players, function (player) { 
            // for each player, call the passed in function 
            // to invoke the strategy for them
            turnStrategy(player, deck);
        });
    }

    // HasWinner takes a function that will be called with all the players 
    // of the game
    HasWinner(winRule: (players: Player[]) =&gt; { }) { 
        return winRule(this.players);        
    }

    // We can have static members 
    static Start(players: Player[], assignDealer: bool) { 
        return new Game(players, new Deck());

<p>So now that all the types are defined, we can simulate a game. The game code is simple but it shows the kind of flexibility that you could use to simulate a lot of different card games. Here is a summary of what happens: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Define the players </li>

  <li>Start the game </li>

  <li>Simulate a round where players pluck cards from the deck </li>

  <li>Calculate a winner with the following algorithm: total up the value of each player’s cards and whoever has the most wins. </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the code: </p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="brush: csharp">// define the players
var gamers = [new Player(&quot;Stan&quot;), new Player(&quot;Jack&quot;), new Player(&quot;Adi&quot;)];

// start the game
var game = Game.Start(gamers, false);

// play a round
game.PlayRound(
    // pass a function where each player plucks cards 
    (p: Player, d: Deck) =&gt;{ p.PluckCards(d, 3);}
);

// figure out the winner by taking each player's cards
// and totaling up their value
var winner = &lt;player&gt;game.HasWinner(
    (players: Player[]) =&gt; {
        var rankings = _.sortBy(players, function (player: Player) {
            return _.reduce(player.hand, function (memo, card: Card) {
                return memo + card.getValue()
                    * -1; // reverse order
            }, 0);
        });

        _.each(rankings, function (p: Player) {
            p.ShowHand();
        });

        return _.take(rankings, 1);
    }
);

// this prints out the winning hand 
winner.ShowHand();</pre>
</div>

  <br /><font size="3"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font></p>

<p>Could I have written this in JavaScript? Sure. TypeScript by no means defines anything so radically new that I would have to use it over my own object oriented JavaScript modeling. However, I think the above demonstrates the advantage – all the while I wrote my code not only could I structure things within the statically typed paradigm that I’m used to, for example with inheritance, I also had compiler checking. This isn’t as big of a deal with small JavaScript driven pages but as your programs get bigger, the more useful something like that can become. </p>

<p>The one area of TypeScript that I found awkward was runtime debugging. It was easy enough to use the Chrome Developer Tools to set a break point and step through code but it almost felt like my mind had to compile the TypeScript into the JavaScript I was debugging… fairly trivial in my utterly contrived card games but something that could be problematic as a web application gets bigger and bigger. </p>

<p>Charles Petzold wrote an essay sometime back with the completely valid title/assertion “<a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/etc/doesvisualstudiorotthemind.html" target="_blank">Does Visual Studio Rot The Mind?</a>” Many people who use TypeScript will like it because it will make their lives easier, giving them auto completion and some other things that they are used to with languages like C#. For them TypeScript might erode their ability to think in terms of JavaScript on its own terms and it will limit them from any library or platform that doesn’t snap in to the TypeScript universe as easily as something like underscore.js. It’s valid to be apprehensive about people like that for their own sakes. But for me and what I do, I like the concept and I see the opportunity for productivity increases with it especially as the tooling gets better. </p>
