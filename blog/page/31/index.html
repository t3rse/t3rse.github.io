<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />One thing I&#8217;m very interested in hearing about at TechEd is going to be the <a href="http://atlas.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabid=47">Microsoft Atlas </a>framework.  Ajax is haute couture and Atlas seems to be at the center of Microsoft&#8217;s strategy.  On my current project I took a look at using Atlas but never really &#8220;got&#8221; the benefits of the technology.  The declarative side of things seems to be designed for the IDE, and without the IDE here it&#8217;s a bit of a non-intuitive hassle to hand code things out.   The second thing that made me leary was the direction Atlas took towards web services.  The tasks I needed to perform were very simple and I shuddered when I thought about how much overhead there would be, say, for a webservice whose only job was to send me a filtered list of things for a dropdown.  In the end I used my own XmlHttp and a bit of POX (I love that acronym, &#8220;Plain Old XML&#8221;) to send things back and forth.  Also courtesy of the O&#8217;Reilly <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/ajaxhks/index.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ajax Hacks</span></a> book I got a handle on <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> and how awesome it is when it comes to sending things from the server and handling it with client side javascript. <br /><br />Today I listened to <a href="http://dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showID=177">Ken Alstad</a> interviewed on <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com">.NET Rocks</a> concerning Atlas and it confirmed my suspicions on Atlas leveraging web services and how easy it was to &#8220;bind&#8221; data from the server using javascript.<br /><br />It&#8217;s interesting that there seem to be two directions here - looking on the open source side of things, <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a> seems to be generating quite a buzz.  I ran into Prototype in December courtesy of <a href="http://www.24ways.org/">24 ways</a> and it took about 35 minutes to really &#8220;get&#8221; it.  Prototype is getting mixed in with a lot of JSON and other javascript libraries and techniques for some pretty cool stuff like script.aculo.us. <br /><br />On the Microsoft side we&#8217;re waiting for Atlas to become standardized, complete, (marketable?).  It&#8217;s declarative, more IDE friendly it seems, and at least for me, less intuitive.<br /><br />Anyway, part of the problem might be my ability to understand it and see where I can leverage it so I&#8217;m going to be in <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/Weblogs/CategoryView,category,Jeff%20Prosise.aspx">Jeff Prosise&#8217;s</a> session on Atlas at TechEd. A few questions I&#8217;m thinking of are as follows:<br /><br />1. How to control when data is bound, doing filtering and other operations using javsacript.<br />2. Will Atlas play well with JSON?  Not JSON being shoehorned into some Atlas app, but more like the ability to return JSON style strings from the server.<br />3. What sort of IDE interface can we expect with Atlas&#8217;s release?  Can we expect any improvements to javascript editing in Visual Studio as a result?<br /><br />&#8230; I&#8217;m sure there are more, and I&#8217;m sure that after the session I&#8217;ll have a much clearer picture of Atlas and it&#8217;s future in web apps for Microsoft developers.  I am pretty sure we made the right choice on the current project, but a year from now I could be singing praises for Atlas.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I&#8217;ve just got to Jack W. Reeves thoughts on <a href="http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design_main.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Code as Design</span></a> in his seminal article originally in the now defunct <span style="font-style: italic;">C++ Journal</span>, and now republished on <a href="http://www.developerdotstar.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">developer.*</span></a>.  I really liked his thoughts and although I can&#8217;t necessarily say it&#8217;s been something intuitively sitting in the back of my mind, its implications are definitely something I&#8217;ve thought for a very long time.<br /><br />The basic premise of his article is stated early: <span style="font-weight: bold;">final source code is the real software design</span>.  From the source code design specification, a compiler and linker do the manufacturing work to implement the software from what one could term the design document of source code.  He continues to discuss some implications of this that are well thought out and, from my experience, very true.<br /><br />A great thing about the article is the return to the notion of engineering and software development being treated together.  These days I see a lot of writing about how the words software and engineering could never go together, but as Reeves shows, there is a very real relationship between disciplines especially if we think of our code as a design document.<br /><br />But the real implication for me, beyond the ones stated by Reeves, has to do with the title &#8220;Software Architect&#8221; - which I happen to hold (not overly meaningful, by the way - everyone at my company is a &#8220;Software Architect&#8221;).  People with the title, who wield Visio, Use Cases, and management-speak <span style="font-style: italic;">exclusively</span>, aren&#8217;t the real architects of the system.  Of course these tools are very useful, and of course general direction is always necessary for a project, but for the notion of a real &#8220;Software Architect&#8221; one has to stay close to the code - close to the actual design document - to really shape the manufacturing process.  Although staying close doesn&#8217;t mean, to me, writing every line of code oneself, it means understanding and being a part of the process of making it.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I&#8217;m very, very excited to be going to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2006/default.mspx">Microsoft&#8217;s TechEd</a> conference this year with my boss.  Now I&#8217;m counting down the days - we leave for Boston on June 10, and the conference runs from June 11 - 16.  The first conference I was able to talk my way into going to was VBITS 2000, and as I think back upon my years training and consulting for my previous employer, that was among the best. <br /><br />I got to rub shoulders with some pretty amazing people, and learned many valuable lessons.  I&#8217;ll never forget sheepishly asking <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/aaron/">Aaron Skonnard</a> what he thought of XML Data Islands in IE 5, or <a href="http://betav.com/BLOG/billva/">Bill Vaughn&#8217;s</a> theatrics (and knowledge) of data access.<br /><br />I think my approach and goals at the conference may be a little different from some people who are looking forward to a week off to fraternize and network.  I&#8217;m hoping to learn as much as possible since I&#8217;m not sure when next I&#8217;ll get the opportunity to go to a conference on my employer&#8217;s expense.<br /><br />The biggest trick is going to be separating the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html">Fire & Motion</a> from the sessions that will give me knowledge and direction for the work I do on a daily basis.  Of course it&#8217;s good to be aware of what&#8217;s upcoming, but I&#8217;ve always been really reluctant to spend much of an investment in something that is subject to change.  Beyond that I usually prefer to wait when adopting something for a little while (let others be the bug testers) so that also pits me against things that are a bit too futuristic.<br /><br />With that said, <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/te06/DavidTechEd.pdf">here is my schedule</a> for the week.  There are a few things I&#8217;d like to see this year (list is totally subject to change, like, on a minute by minute basis):<br /><br />1. More ASP.NET 2.0<br />Deeper on the new features, Personalization API, Web Parts, Internals<br /><br />2. XML / XQuery / LINQ<br />Some ideas on where these are in the pipeline so I can start using them on projects<br /><br />3. Workflow<br />I have DVDs of the last TechEd, and this came up a bit. I&#8217;m interested again on seeing an angle to take on this tool.<br /><br />4. Sharepoint and Biztalk<br />I signed up for a few sessions but this is the part where I get leary; I&#8217;m not sure when the 2007 versions will be out and about.  I know there are many, many opportunities to use the current versions of these products and would probably benefit from seeing that kind of stuff right away.  But I&#8217;m hoping to glean and perhaps get a few tidbits to stay ahead of the curve when the new versions are released.<br /><br />5. Team System<br />We are using it in house, so I need to understand it - I also want to get an accurate picture of how Team System can be leveraged by small teams.  Most descriptions (and the pricing!) seems to put it in the &#8220;enterprise&#8221; category but most of what I&#8217;ve worked on in the past, and probably for the forseeable future will be software projects with less than 20 people involved. <br /><br />6. IIS 7<br />I use IIS every day, and it&#8217;s been like an old friend since the early versions. I&#8217;d like to see where the product is headed, and how its path meets with ASP.NET 2.0 and all the other pieces of web application development.<br /><br />7. Architecture Talks<br />I signed up for a few that will hopefully be interesting and useful.  I&#8217;d also like to get a better handle on SOA, &#8220;contracts,&#8221; and the like.  Distributed architecture makes a lot of sense to me, but I&#8217;m a bit wary of the architecture astronauts when it comes to enterprise application architectures - I try to translate that stuff into what I do on a daily basis (enterprise app for a publicly traded company of 5000+ employees) and still sometimes miss the mark.  Perhaps I&#8217;ll get a chance to meet some people in this environment as well who I can maintain contact with.<br /><br />I&#8217;m hoping that I&#8217;ll be able to change sessions as well during the conference. I&#8217;m fairly pleased with what I have, but the flexibility would be nice.<br /><br />As the week progresses I&#8217;ll hopefully write down some things I&#8217;ll be hoping to answer, as well as some pre-conference reading. <br /><br />TechEd 2006, here I come!<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>

Pretty easy job.<br /><br />I do recommend to learn as much as possible about ASP.NET 2.0 internals. For example: handlers, modules, providers, lifecycle, script-oriented API around the Page class. To learn as much as possible about best practices for control development.<br /><br />In this regard, I wrote quite a few articles for the ASP.NET DevCenter in the past months to form a sort of crashcourse on control development. &#8221;</blockquote>That&#8217;s some great advice and it exposes a few personal areas that could see growth.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />In my teaching years I&#8217;d often run into people who thought they understood things that they really didn&#8217;t.  Today, spreading like a fire I found a series of &#8220;do you know&#8221; posts that measured levels of understanding in three technologies most people think they understand: <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200605/levels_of_html_knowledge/">HTML</a>, <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2006/06/levels/">Javascript</a>, and <a href="http://friendlybit.com/css/levels-of-css-knowledge/">CSS</a>.<br /><br />Of course a personal evaluation leaves one open to questions but I think I&#8217;m doing okay level-wise. I wasn&#8217;t at the top in any of the posts, but just a notch below.<br /><br />When it comes to technologies, even those that I use on a daily basis (like the above) I&#8217;m always loathe to say I have a maximum level of knowledge because I am well aware of those who sit on the top of the food chain in whatever areas of knowlege it might be: I&#8217;m no <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/">Eric Meyer</a> when it comes to CSS, I&#8217;m no <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/">Thomas Fuchs</a> when it comes to javascript, and although I know much of what there is to know about HTML, I haven&#8217;t spent (what I consider to be a waste of) time navigating differences in rendering on different browsers and standards support unless it&#8217;s been a big problem on a project.<br /><br />Well, here&#8217;s to all of us who are still learning&#8230;<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I recently was trying to write some javascript that interacted with the ASP.NET 2.0 RadioButtonList.  My first attempts at obtaining a handle to the control via <span style="font-style: italic;">document.getElementById</span> were successful but unsuccessful. Successful in that they weren&#8217;t giving me a &#8220;null&#8221; reference back, but unsuccessful in that I was not getting the selected value of the radio buttons.<br /><br />It turns out the RadioButtonList is rendered as an HTML Table element, with the table getting the corresponding id of the server control and the radio buttons getting id values that had an increment on the end. Their name attribute, which groups them, was the same as the RadioButtonList id.<br /><br />Simple example: you have a RadioButtonList you give an id of myList.  ASP.NET 2.0 renders a table with the id attribute of &#8220;myList.&#8221;  You&#8217;ll have your radio buttons inside, named myList_0, myList_1, and so on.  These radio buttons, rendered as <span style="font-style: italic;">getElementsByTagName(&#8220;input&#8221;) </span>to get your radio buttons.  Test to see which is selected and you&#8217;re all done.  The following function encapsulates that logic, and we&#8217;ve begun reusing it all over the place. The radioList argument should just be the ClientId of your RadioButtonList:<br /><br />       function getRadioSelectedValue(radioList){<br />           var options = radioList.getElementsByTagName(&#8216;input&#8217;);<br />           for(i=0;i&lt;options.length;i++){<br />               var opt = options[i];<br />               if(opt.checked){<br />                   return opt.value;<br />               }<br />           }<br />       }<br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" ><br />}</span></div>

thanks for the helpfull post.<BR/>just to clear 1 thing, u said that the&#8221;radioList&#8221; is the id of the radio object, but it must be the client elemnet itself.<BR/>in case the user want to send only the client id, the first line of the function must change to:<BR/>var options = document.getElementById(radioList).getElementByTagName etc..</div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />My reading of Schneier has continued.  He still proves to be a very accomodating writer; consider the following on the &#8220;One-Time Pad,&#8221; a encryption scheme that can be literally unbreakable:<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;Many Soviet spy messages to agents were encrypted using one-time pads.  These messages are still secure today and will remain that way forever. It doesn&#8217;t matter how long the supercomputers work on the problem. Even after the aliens from Andromeda land with their massive spaceships and undreamed-of computing power, they will not be able to read the Soviet spy messages encrypted with one-time pads (unless they can also go back in time and get the one-time pads).&#8221;</blockquote>In the second chapter he is discussing the basics of protocols and describes the one-way hash: &#8220;a function, mathematical or otherwise, that takes a variable-length input string (pre-image) and converts it to a fixed-length output string.  Essentially, a computed hash represents a fixed length byte array that is unique for whatever its input stream was.  This is interesting and useful beyond cryptography. <br /><br />Here&#8217;s a simple idea from Steve Oualline&#8217;s book &#8221;<a href="http://www.nostarch.com/frameset.php?startat=wcps"><span style="font-style: italic;">Wicked Cool Perl Scripts</span></a>,&#8221; but implemented in C#: you can compute a hash to check to see if two files are different or the same.<br /><br />The following code uses the System.IO and System.Security.Cryptography namespaces:<br /><br />        private static bool CompareFiles(string path1, string path2) {<br />            byte[] hash1 = GetMD5Hash(path1);<br />            byte[] hash2 = GetMD5Hash(path2);<br />            for (int i = 0; i < hash1.Length; i++)<br />            {<br />                if (hash1[i] != hash2[i])<br />                {<br />                    return false;<br />                }<br />            }<br />            return true;<br />        }<br /><br />        private static byte[] GetMD5Hash(string pth)<br />        {<br />            MD5 hasher = MD5.Create();<br />            byte[] fileBytes = File.ReadAllBytes(pth);<br />            byte[] hash = hasher.ComputeHash(fileBytes);<br />            return hash;<br />        }<br /><br />I was curious about the performance of this technique - I was originally testing it on 40MB files.  I extracted some old database backup files - about 200MB a piece and the comparison took somewhere on the order of 20 seconds.  My laptop has a P4  3Ghz with  1GB of RAM.  Nice, but not out of the ordinary (especially these days).  I&#8217;ve also got suspicions that the speed was not necessarily on the hash computation, but rather on reading out the byte array in the file. I&#8217;ll test sometime to see&#8230;<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">}</span></span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />One of my jedi masters, <a href="http://www.markitup.com">Darren Neimke</a>, posted <a href="http://markitup.com/Posts/Post.aspx?postId=1ab79b38-4114-4428-b77f-623025081bae">the following</a> about having personal projects:<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;One of the questions that I always ask is for the applicant to tell me about their favorite personal project that they have going right now.  It&#8217;s a bit of a loaded question I suppose because of how it assumes that they do have a personal project - but that&#8217;s almost my point.  Having a personal project (or more than one) is a trait that is shared by every developer that I respect and so I rate it rather highly.&#8221;</blockquote>Interesting, because my latest &#8220;personal&#8221; project is a tool I called <span style="font-style: italic;">Palantir</span> which let&#8217;s the developers browse around the database getting schema information much more quickly and effeciently than writing queries like:<br /><br /><blockquote>select * from information_schema.columns where table_name = &#8216;foo&#8217;<br />or<br />select * from information_schema.columns where column_name like &#8216;%foo%&#8217;<br /></blockquote>It pleasures me to no end when I walk through our work area and see it running on everyone&#8217;s machines.  Usually in the evening I add features that are in response to feedback and what I think will make it more effective of a tool.  For example, one screen, devoted to exposing stored procedures, displayed TSQL without syntax highlighting and it became a request.  That evening I spent some time with regular expressions and search/replace to get a &#8220;pretty&#8221; version of procedure definitions into the software.<br /><br />Invariably the question of why I wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">Palantir</span> comes up, and my response usually a bit of surprise; I thought everyone had little pet projects of software they worked on at home.  In fact, most don&#8217;t.  In fact, as I ask around, I find that I&#8217;m quite unique in that environment for working on my own stuff at home. <br /><br />I don&#8217;t think it necessarily defines me as a better programmer but I know that it&#8217;s when I write my own stuff that I get that free reign to improve my skills instead of working against a spec and a deadline.  My projects give me a chance to do things with regular expressions, backreferences, web services, RSS, XML, and a ton of other things that don&#8217;t come up in the regular work day.<br /><br />I&#8217;m still considering what to do with <span style="font-style: italic;">Palantir</span>; I want to keep it personal for now so that I can work in some more features and leave it with my personal vision at its core.  Then I may work up the courage to put it up on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Default.aspx">CodePlex</a> or <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />It&#8217;s easy to reset a page to it&#8217;s initial state in ASP.NET by redirecting to itself. Here are 3 ways you can do it:<br /><br />1. Response.Redirect(Request.Path);<br /><br />In which the path to the request is presented in the following form: /MyApp/MyFile.aspx<br /><br />2. Response.Redirect(Request.RawUrl);<br /><br />In which not only is the path exposed, but also any querystring parameters like:<br />/MyApp/MyFile.aspx?foo=bar<br /><br />3. Response.Redirect(Request.Url.ToString());<br /><br />In which not only is the path and querystring parameters exposed, but made available as an absolute reference in the form:<br />http://MyServer/MyApp/MyFile.aspx?foo=bar<br /><br />Interestingly enough, if you have a named anchor in the form of &lt;a name=#test<a name="#test"></a>, this is not exposed by any of these methods!  (You&#8217;ll see how I know a post or so from now, but suffices to say that you can still get this information from the client side by parsing the window.location object:<br /><br />alert(window.location);<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />A coworker loaned me Bruce Schneier&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471117099/sr=8-2/qid=1147663452/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-3891244-6271812?%5Fencoding=UTF8"><span style="font-style: italic;">Applied Cryptography</span></a>.  So far it&#8217;s a very interesting book, and surprisingly readable.  I may see if I can work my way through various forms of encryption but translate his samples to C#.  Here&#8217;s a version of a substitution cipher that uses XOR operations in C# (make sure you&#8217;re using System.Text):<br /><br />        private static string Cipher(byte key, string plainText)<br />        {<br />            byte[] plain = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(plainText);<br />            byte[] ciph = new byte[plain.Length];<br />            for (int i = 0; i < plain.Length; i++)<br />            {<br />                ciph[i] = (byte)(++key ^ plain[i]);<br />            }<br /><br />            string cipherText = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetString(ciph);<br />            return cipherText;<br />        }<br /><br />To decrypt, if you have the key:<br /><br />        private static string Decipher(byte key, string cipherText)<br />        {<br />            byte[] ciph = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(cipherText);<br />            byte[] plain = new byte[ciph.Length];<br />            for (int i = 0; i < ciph.Length; i++)<br />            {<br />                plain[i] = (byte)(++key ^ ciph[i]);<br />            }<br /><br />            string plainText = ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetString(plain);<br />            return plainText;<br />        }<br /><br />Back to my earlier comment on Schneier being readable, his comments on this approach are as follows:<br /><br /><blockquote>&#8220;&#8230; the list of software vendors that tout this toy algorithm as being &#8220;almost as secure as DES&#8221; is staggering&#8230; An XOR might keep your kid sister from reading your files, but it won&#8217;t stop a cryptanalyst for more than a few minutes.&#8221;</blockquote><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
