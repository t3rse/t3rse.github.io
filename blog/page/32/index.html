I agree in the sense that it&#8217;s small things you&#8217;d have never thought of that clinch software.  I disagree that this can be applied to all Mac software; I am just now coming back from a session with ProTools, powerful software to be sure, but filled with lots of hidden menus, features, and quirks.<br /><br />Nothing makes me happy like good software, especially in the moments when it&#8217;s obvious that something I want to do has really had some thought applied to it.  Printing in gmail, for example. Multiple tabs in Firefox.  The ! shortcuts for searching in yahoo. iTunes burning an audio file that&#8217;s too big across multiple CDs.  Oh, and the smart playlists on iTunes too.  I should make a list someday&#8230;<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />The secret&#8217;s already been partially out that I&#8217;m attempting to return to school to study Computer Science.  Part of the requirements for <a href="http://www.uis.edu/">the school</a> I&#8217;m trying to attend is a program of some sort written in Java along with a personal statement.  I <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/javaSamples/AppRunner.java.txt">submitted </a>a ported variation of a program I wrote a while back in C# as a response to <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,f3b9ba36-848e-43f8-9caa-232ec216192d.aspx">this blog entry</a>. My program applies a Haar transform on an image file.<br /><br />It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve used Java. I downloaded and used <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> as my IDE, and that was a great experience - I&#8217;m curious to know if the GUI development parts of Eclipse are well developed.<br /><br />Working in Java, after all this time in C#, was a bit strange.  There are the small arbitrary things, like camelCase for methods rather than PascalCase, and then there are the bigger things, like doing type conversion (in .NET I just use Convert.ToXXYYZZ (e.g. Convert.ToInt32, Convert.ToDouble, and so on&#8230; )), and then there are the massive things like trying to emit an image file to disk. In C# this is very trivial. In Java, it&#8217;s painful enough that doing a search on Google will yield all kinds of Bitmap implementations that people have written to make up for a lack of support in the language. <br /><br />Speaking of which, the program took about 2 hours to port but for these lines:<br /><br /><blockquote>File output = new File(filePath);<br />ImageIO.write(myBufferedImage,&#8221;<span style="font-weight: bold;">bmp</span>&#8221;, output);</blockquote><br /><br />The kept succeeding only in writing an empty bmp file. I didn&#8217;t stop to figure out the debugger in Eclipse (wouldn&#8217;t have mattered if I did), but couldn&#8217;t for the life of me get to the root of the issue. <br /><br />I used to think Javadoc comments were such a beautiful thing until I began searching Google for ImageIO.write examples.  Apparently <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/imageio/ImageIO.html">everyone</a> <a href="http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/Flicker/javadocs/ImageIO.html">has</a> <a href="http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/Flicker/javadocs/ImageIO.html"><a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Courses/comp118-s04/docs/documentation/jdk1.5/docs/api/javax/imageio/metadata/class-use/IIOMetadata.html">taken</a></a> <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/local/computing/software/j2sdk-1.4.2/docs/api/javax/imageio/class-use/ImageWriter.html">it</a> <a href="http://www.codase.com/java/">upon</a> <a href="http://developer.classpath.org/doc/overview-summary.html">themselves</a> to have a copy of the Javadoc online with redundant information.  And the Javadoc itself has <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/imageio/ImageIO.html#write%28java.awt.image.RenderedImage,%20java.lang.String,%20java.io.File%29">no clear information</a> about the method either, especially for cases like mine where it succeeds, over and over again, at creating nothing. (Why not use an enumerated type for the format parameter of the write method if it&#8217;s going to be limited?)<br /><br />After a few hours I&#8217;m at the video game point of debugging (just trying different things) and ran it with the following:<br /><br /><blockquote>File output = new File(filePath);<br />ImageIO.write(myBufferedImage,&#8221;<span style="font-weight: bold;">jpg</span>&#8221;, output);</blockquote><br />Lo and behold, a file is created on my machine.  And it sort of clears up for me that the write method&#8217;s format is limited out of the box ( I think, but did not confirm) to jpg / gif / png formats.  I&#8217;m guessing at a disdain for &#8220;bmp&#8221; as a Windows specific format or something of that nature pushing ImageIO to exclude it in its base support.  Although there may be ways around this (I saw a class called ImageWriter which may have had those capabilities) it makes me really wonder.<br /><br />I think it also shows a difference between Microsoft and other companies.  At Microsoft, they&#8217;ll spend extraordinary efforts for a guy like me on a weekend like this to be able to write:<br /><br /><blockquote>Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap();<br />// do stuff<br />bmp.Save(&#8220;pathToFile.bmp&#8221;);</blockquote><br />We could all write <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip60.html">our own implementations</a> of a Bitmap helper class, but IMHO, I&#8217;d rather be thinking about other things like perfecting the transform.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />The <a href="http://perlcast.com/2006/07/12/practices-of-an-agile-developer/">latest Perlcast</a> features <a href="http://toolshed.com/blog/">Andy Hunt</a>, one of the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/">Pragmatic Programmers</a>, talking about Agile Programming.  Although my use of perl in a professional context is limited, Perlcast is one of my favorite developer podcasts in no small part to its host, Josh McAdams -<br /><br />The following are discussed:<br /><br />1. Pair programming<br />Andy gives an analogy of a driver and navigator.  Interesting, but I have to admit the whole pair thing has never quite had appeal for me. At least, not as the &#8220;navigator.&#8221;<br /><br />2. Learning sessions<br />Andy recommends company learning sessions in the middle of the week (my own company does it on Friday).  It&#8217;s a good idea since the beginning of the week is catch up usually, and by the end a lot of people have checked out.  I do like the fact that on Friday, however, there is a bit more of a relaxed atmosphere in the office, making the learning sessions double as a sort of group bonding where the developers can hang out and not feel too much stress. <br /><br />3. On keeping up with what&#8217;s current<br />Focus on awareness, not necessarily depth.  It&#8217;s impossible to know about absolutely everything going on, but keep your radar going and understand the big picture meaning of what&#8217;s new.  Easily said, but I will admit to frequent moments like today: feeling utterly overwhelmed by  the amount of useful information that&#8217;s out there. And no time to process the little I get a handle on from time to time.<br /><br />4. Estimation<br />Andy&#8217;s gotten companies to go with incremental estimates of time for projects.  This is a great idea, but as Andy seemed to concede, it&#8217;s sometimes hard to get a client to look at things that way.  Because budgeting for a project is usually based on a proposal, and the proposal must take into account the entire scope of work, I wonder at a good angle from which to introduce this&#8230; maybe with shorter cycles up front.  Unfortunately, the beginning of a project is usually a lot of design work and may not involve a ton of demonstrated progress.  Hm&#8230;<br /><br />5. Testing<br />Wow - this was the best part of the podcast.  Andy goes through a bunch of acronyms to use to remember the different ways to approach unit testing.  I&#8217;m not usually one for acronyms, but in this case I think it can&#8217;t hurt.  He recommends as much test code as production code&#8230; a really tough sell since I don&#8217;t think any of the clients I&#8217;ve worked with run numbers on bug fixing costs.  Because of that what&#8217;s important to budget both time and financially is the &#8220;development&#8221; cycle and whatever is left over before the magic deadline must be applied to bugs.<br />But here&#8217;s where I take it: the half/half production/test code thing is about the effort a developer makes to test and have automated unit tests available for their code.  And, from a guy who&#8217;s spent the last many days almost exclusively fixing bugs, I&#8217;d rather invest in test cases than bug fixes.  I&#8217;ll have to strategize on having lots of shiny things to throw at the client in order to demonstrate progress but somehow pace development so that much more is invested in unit testing.<br /><br />6. SCRUM<br />Andy finishes with some talk about <a href="http://www.controlchaos.com/">SCRUM</a> as a lightweight development process. I&#8217;ll have to read into that a bit; it seems to formalize some of the things that I&#8217;ve done in the past but it seems like a magical ideal that is very difficult to be disciplined with in real life. For example, quick meetings at the beginning of each day tend to expand in the amount of time they take. A lot of the time, if there&#8217;s something that is really involved (like it&#8217;s going to take a few days or weeks to develop) I prefer to just get to work and get into my code since mornings are one of the more productive times of day for me.<br />One thing we&#8217;ve done on my current project is have an email sent out that lists what everyone is working on, seems like a good compromise.<br /><br />7. Write readable code<br />&#8216;nuff said.<br /><br />8.  Some OO design commentary, bleeds into contracts, encapsulation.<br /><br />9. Architects should code.<br />I think Joel said it all when he <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">wrote</a> about Architecture Astronauts. Another funny article I recently refound online a  humorous essay about  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a href="http://www.acmqueue.org/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&amp;pid=130">UML Fever</a>.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I&#8217;m not one for exhibit halls; even the &#8220;swag&#8221; is sometimes not worth having to talk to the sales people.  At TechEd, I did happen upon the Sparx Systems booth and after a brief exchange with the Australian guy who was manning the booth and who was definitely a developer (takes one to know one), I became interested in their <a href="http://www.sparxsystems.com/products/ea.html">Enterprise Architect</a> software.<br /><br />UML modelling for $200?  Most of the tools I know of are the Rational &#8220;don&#8217;t even bother if you&#8217;re not a large government&#8221; scale.  It supports code generation for many languages: Java, Python, PHP, Delphi, as well as the Microsoft staples, C++, C#, and VB.NET.  Wow, now I&#8217;m really interested.  More?  It generates Xml Schema as well.<br /><br />It&#8217;s all really interesting since certain people (who I&#8217;ll avoid mentioning on the blog since it will sound redundant) have me really interested in Model Driven Architecture and the idea of modelling and coming up with contracts and then generating code.<br /><br />I am using the trial version now (arg! I installed it a few weeks ago but only started using it seriously over the weekend which gives me 10 more days left to work with it) and find myself really comfortable with the interface and functionality.  I used the documentation to see how enumerations worked and that was a snap.  I generated C# code which worked quite well.<br /><br />The last thing I did was to <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.364615.10">post</a> on Joel on Software to see if anyone had had any bad experiences and it seemed like everyone said nice things.<br /><br />Now I am working up the courage to ask the boss to buy it. I can anticipate two questions:<br />1. Why not Visio?<br />me: not as light weight, code generation is a bit clunky, adding new types doesn&#8217;t work as well, not as many diagrams supported, no XML Schema generation support that I know of&#8230;<br /><br />2. Why not Class Diagrams in Visual Studio 2005?<br />me: Even more light weight than Visio.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Update: </span>I am now a licensee of Enterprise Architect.  Life is good!<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />According to <a href="http://www.perlmonks.com/?node_id=561229">this article</a> from &#8220;Anonymous Monk.&#8221; I&#8217;d remain anonymous too if I made the claim since people tend to get passionate when it comes to Perl.<br /><br />My personal reaction is this: I like Perl, and I&#8217;d love to use it more, but I&#8217;ve only experienced evidence that supports his arguments as I&#8217;ve been dinking around in Perl over the last few years.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Update</span>: Interestingly enough, the direct link is now dishing out 403 errors.

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />&#8220;Functional Programming&#8221; is a term I&#8217;ve been long accustomed to hearing and generalizing about, but whoever is at the end of defmarco has done a great job in <a href="http://defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html">this essay</a> of unpacking the basics of Functional Programming for those of us who never encountered it in an academic setting. I found it referenced via <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/articles/2006/06/30/javascript-and-continuation-passing-style">John Lam</a>.<br /><br />The essay sweeps through the logic and ideas of Plato, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">geniuses</a> at Princeton who started thinking in lambda expressions, and John McCarthy&#8217;s innovation at MIT of LISP.  From there a case is made for the benefits of Functional Programming along the following lines:<br /><br />1. Unit Testing<br />2. Debugging<br />3. Concurrency<br />4. Hot Code Deployment<br />5. Machine Assisted Proofs and Optimizations<br /><br />The latter part of the essay is defmarco explaining the basics of Functional Programming. Even though the essay is &#8220;for the rest of us&#8221; I admit that the differing style from what I&#8217;m used to in impatrive style did require frequent stopping and mulling.  But it&#8217;s well written and very accessible in its explanation of some of the fundamentals:<br /><br />1. High Order Functions - functions operating on other functions<br />2. Currying - reusing functions by assignment<br />3. Lazy Evaluation - evaluation as needed<br />4. Infinite Data Structures - based on functions<br />5. Continuations - like the stack, but oh so powerful<br />6. Pattern Matching - functions match calls based on parameter values matching<br />7. Closures - state management function to function<br /><br />Great essay, well worth the time and effort.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
