<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I&#8217;m not sure what day I&#8217;m on as far as TechEd coverage (a lot to swallow!) but the next session I see notes for was called &#8220;Location Solutions with Virtual Earth.&#8221;  It was a tour of <a href="http://local.live.com/">Virtual Earth</a> and how to write applications using the javascript library they expose in the <a href="http://dev.live.com/virtualearth/sdk/">Virtual Earth SDK</a>.<br /><br />You can get an idea of what Virtual Earth looks like by going to the site: <a href="http://local.live.com/">http://local.live.com</a><br /><br />The SDK is also quite simple; it consists of referencing some javascript libraries and using a DIV to position the mapped content.  For example, to get the basics, just view source on <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/virtualearth/">this page</a>.<br /><br />The Virtual Earth API has the following features, per the presentation:<br /><br /><ul><li>User Navigation</li><li>Mapping Imagery</li><li>&#8220;Bird&#8217;s Eye&#8221; views</li><li>Pushpins</li><li>Find Places/Addresses</li><li>Directions/Routing</li><li>Polylines</li><li>Collections of GeoRSS</li></ul><br />For each of these features there is an interactive SDK that generates example code so that you can follow along for your own application.  *Very cool*. <br /><br />I did have a few issues with timing and synchronous processing; in other words sometimes the wait time for processing one command seemed to cancel out a command that directly followed it.  In my case I was trying to do a search for &#8220;Sioux Falls, SD&#8221; and then follow it with a ZoomIn method like so:<br /><br />            map.FindLocation(&#8216;Sioux Falls, SD&#8217;);<br />            map.SetMapStyle(VEMapStyle.Hybrid);<br />            map.ZoomIn();<br /><br />I&#8217;ll dig around a bit - my idea for a helpful little location solution is a map of Sioux Falls and all the coffee shops along with their attributes: how good the coffee is, whether WiFi is free, and the general atmosphere.<br /><br />I&#8217;m also planning to dink around with the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps API</a> to see how it stacks up.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.prenia.com/cathi/">Cathi Gero</a> and <a href="http://www.tedneward.com/default.aspx">Ted Neward</a> had a session on what they call &#8220;pragmatic architecture&#8221; - the fuzzy definition of which was architecture that maintains ideals until the consequences outweigh them.<br /><br />It was interesting to get this high level at TechEd; most of the sessions I went to were very technical where this was a balance between philosophy and a general approach to developing software.<br /><br />One of the first thing they went after was the recent infatuation people on the architectural level have had with &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_%28computer_science%29">design patterns</a>.&#8221;  According to them, a cut and paste approach to design patterns is not the path to success - and although I haven&#8217;t immersed myself in the design patterns world, I doubt it&#8217;s proponents probably leave some room for flexibility in implementation. <br /><br />According to Cathi and Ted, the goals of a software architect were twofold:<br />1. Functional Requirements (Business needs, raw functionality)<br />2. Non-functional Requirements (the &#8220;ities&#8221;: scalability, maintainability, extensibility, and so on)<br /><br />Their approach in being pragmatic about architecture was to leverage a vocabulary, not as a means to accomplish the goals of software architecture, but as a lexicon for strategies and tactics in accomplishing those two main goals.  They covered what they called the 6 elements of architecture and examples of approaches (patterns?) that lend themselves to the software of the solution.<br /><br />Here are the 6 architectural &#8220;elements:&#8221;<br /><br />1. Communication<br />2. Presentation (the front end)<br />3. State Management (how the data are stored)<br />4. Processing<br />5. Resource Management<br />6. Tools<br /><br />For each of the 6 they presented examples of what we see with most modern software.  Under Communication, for example, they listed what they call as a &#8220;three part tuple:&#8221;<br /><br />1. Transport<br />TCP, UDP, other network protocols<br />2. Exchange<br />Data can be exchanged using request/response, asynchronous, fire and forget, amongst others<br />3. Format<br />XML, Text, JSON, Binary, and so on.<br /><br />Presentation has to do with the interface for the user.  Some examples given here were Console, Graphical Interface, and Markup.<br /><br />The State Model to apply in the application in pragmatic language is either durable (available always) or transient (available only certain times).  Another consideration for State Management is the &#8220;shape&#8221; of the data: objects, relational, heirarchical, etc&#8230; Finally when considering the State Model there was the notion of where the data was: client, server, elsewhere&#8230;<br /><br />Processing used in the application, some examples of implementation they gave were: Procedural, Imperative, Concurrent, Parallel, and Transactional.  On the processing side, however, some higher level descriptions of approaches included: Divide and Conquer, Recursive, Event based, Shared Queue, amongst others.<br /><br />Resource Management had to do with persistence of data and configuration. Some styles discussed for this was locator / registry, discovery, injected, and a very sophisticated term for &#8220;hard coding&#8221; called <span style="font-style: italic;">a priori</span>.<br /><br />Tools to consider in being pragmatic could be the programming language, development environment, frameworks, code generation, amongst others.<br /><br />I&#8217;m not sure if this stuff originated with Cathi and Ted, but it&#8217;s very useful in coming up with a high level picture of how software will work. Although most of what I&#8217;ve worked with recently fits under the umbrella of &#8220;web application&#8221; it would be very useful to approach new projects with this catalog and the set of approaches beneath each item in mind.<br /><br />This entire session is available as <a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032297841&EventCategory=5&amp;culture=en-US&CountryCode=US">a webcast</a>, and I&#8217;d recommend it to anyone who is involved in software development, even if they don&#8217;t think of themselves as architects.  There is always a point when I&#8217;m reading or listening to high level stuff like this where I begin to wonder if it really matters but when it is kept concrete like this the distinction between architecture as high level thinking that has to be done anyway, and architecture as romantic &#8220;rah rah&#8221; for the higher ups is very clear.<br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted&#8217;s blog</a> seems fairly alive but <a href="http://blogs.prenia.com/cathi/">Cathi&#8217;s blog</a> has not been updated for a while. <br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><p class="MsoNormal">My Tuesday morning session was with Luca Bolognese, lead program manager on LINQ, covering a slightly different flavor than what Pablo Castro was demonstrating with ADO.NET vNext on Monday morning.<span style="">  </span>Luca’s Italian accent was charming, but it was even more exciting to see what LINQ does on a deeper level.<o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">He started by showing a classical problem that LINQ solves. Imagine a collection of integers which you need to filter out based on a certain criteria, something like: </p>      <p class="MsoNormal">int[] nums = {2,3,5,7,11};<br /><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">It’s usually done with some kind of iteration in the form of: </p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=";font-family:&quot;;font-size:10;"  ><span style="">            </span><span style="color:blue;">int</span>[] nums = { 2,3,5,7,11};<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=";font-family:&quot;;font-size:10;"  ><span style="">            </span><span style="color:teal;">List</span><<span style="color:blue;">int</span>> selected = <span style="color:blue;">new</span> <span style="color:teal;">List</span><<span style="color:blue;">int</span>>();<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=";font-family:&quot;;font-size:10;"  ><span style="">            </span><span style="color:blue;">for</span> (<span style="color:blue;">int</span> i = 0; i <></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=";font-family:&quot;;font-size:10;"  ><span style="">                </span><span style="color:blue;">if</span> (nums[i] > 4) {<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=";font-family:&quot;;font-size:10;"  ><span style="">                    </span>selected.Add(nums[i]);<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=";font-family:&quot;;font-size:10;"  ><span style="">                </span>}<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style=";font-family:&quot;;font-size:10;"  ><span style="">            </span>}<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=";font-family:&quot;;font-size:10;"  ><span style="">            </span><span style="color:green;">// selected represents my values</span></span></p>      <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p>I write code like that on a daily basis, it seems. In LINQ, queries become a “first class” member of the language and operate on anything that implements the IEnumerable interface.<span style="">  </span>A problem like the above can be solved without line noise and iteration:<o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">int[] nums = {2,3,5,7,11};</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">var selected = from i in nums </p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">                        </span>where i > 4</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">                        </span>select i;</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">From the perspective of someone who writes the iteration + selection stuff every day, I think that LINQ is going to have a big impact on my code.<span style="">  </span>But this is just the beginning. Luca then showed how LINQ is split out to target several different forms of data structures:<o:p> </o:p></p>  <ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="1" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal" style="">LINQ      to Objects (Anything implementing IEnumerable, collections etc… )</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="">LINQ      enabled ADO.NET (mapping database structures to objects and then querying      off of them)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="">LINQ      to XML</li></ol>    <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>The first example above is a typical LINQ to Objects scenario where filtering, querying, or manipulation can be applied to a collection that supports IEnumerable.<span style="">  </span>Being able to do this sort of manipulation on HashTables, DictionaryEntries, and so on is the type of power that I demonstrated above.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">In a LINQ enabled ADO.NET scenario, you can take an object that is mapped to some entity in your database and query off of it. I don’t recall the exact demonstration, but an example would be querying a collection of “customer” objects based on some filter: </p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">var topcustomers = from customer in customers</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">                                    </span>where customer.orderCount > 10</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">                                    </span>select {customer.id, customer.fullName};</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">I’ve heard a lot about ORM ever since my friend <a href="http://www.cephas.net/blog/">Aaron</a> started talking about Hibernate (some time ago) but what catapults this over the typical ORM scenario is that the functionality is built into language and not abstracted through method calls.<span style="">  </span>I’ve been a bit lukewarm to the notion since it seemed like a lot of work up front and because this type of abstraction where objects can represent data and provide some manipulative capacity is already built in the DataSet/DataTable model.<span style="">  </span>However two things make LINQ enabled ADO.NET a little different: first, the IDE facilitates the mappings that are made through an “EDM” diagram and mapping providers that give a lot of flexibility in connecting to the datastore, secondly the developer wields a lot of control over how the mapping works and how things are updated – the queries, the stored procedures, all data access still belongs to you and not to some “tool.”</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Finally the LINQ enabled XML is powerful – it exposes XML data to yet another format of “query” besides XQuery and XPath.<span style="">  </span>There is also the ability to work with the hierarchical structure that XML documents sometimes expose as collections within collections.<span style="">  </span>The LINQ processing, with a bit of instruction, can also be instructed how to retrieve content (depth first traversal, and so on).</p>      <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/lucabol/">Luca’s blog</a> seems to have died, but for some interesting tidbits, it’s here.<span style="">  </span>Maybe with a few hits it can start up again?<o:p><br /></o:p></p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />An amazing session with Mahesh Prakriya and John Lam came on Monday night. Mahesh was covering the <a href="http://www.ironpython.com/">IronPython</a> efforts for .NET and John came to talk about Ruby.  It was refreshing to see the smaller number of developers practically using .NET but for whom language mattered.<br /><br />Mahesh gave a history of Python support in the CLR and made a case for dynamic languages within .NET.  His examples were pretty cool, especially when he started with a few examples of Python:<br /><br />2 + 2  (room is quiet)<br />22**64 (room is quiet - David is amazed at the response in milliseconds)<br /><br />He also showed a powerful implementation of a Matlab / Mathematica type tool written in Python for .NET. <br /><br />John&#8217;s part of the talk was also very good - he has written a bridge between Ruby and the CLR.  John was fairly funny and expressive and his demos of Ruby and the CLR were fairly good in giving a picture of what he was tring to do.<br /><br />John&#8217;s blog is <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/">here</a>, Mahesh doesn&#8217;t blog but a search on Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Mahesh+Prakriya&amp;btnG=Google+Search">shows him</a> in a few places.  I&#8217;m going to be downloading Iron Python and RubyCLR in the next month or so.  Not completely sure, but it seems that <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/articles/2006/03/16/third-drop-of-rubyclr">here</a> is where one can find RubyCLR.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />One of the best talks of this week was Pablo Castro&#8217;s Monday session covering some of the new features of ADO.NET.  Having used some form of data access library from Microsoft for a while, the changes he showed were fairly dramatic, and they will really impact on a fundamental level how programmers think about data access when it becomes widely available.<br /><br />The general direction from Microsoft seems to be giving more modelling capabilities to developers to manage in an application space.  The original step in this direction was ADO.NET from which we can model on the application level using a DataSet and it&#8217;s associated classes.  But the features in ADO.NET vNext - and I hesitate on superlatives - are an unparalleled shift (in my short life as a developer) in what we do for data access.<br /><br />The rational behind my claim of this being as big a change is that it is no longer limited to the object model or some IDE-fu that Microsoft implements in Visual Studio.  This change is a part of the language with which we express ourselves when talking to the database.  My rational is LINQ.<br /><br />LINQ is simply understood by unpacking the acronym: language integrated query.  From a syntactical point of view in ADO.NET we can obtain a reference to the database and retrieve a collection of objects that represent what&#8217;s inside.<br /><br />I think this is a huge revelation - something that goes well beyond even the Object Relational stuff I hear about from time to time simply because it&#8217;s not just objects, it&#8217;s syntax.<br /><br />Around LINQ as a syntactical approach to getting data from the database is the ability to create what is now called an EDM diagram which is essentially a mapping of the database to the class types that will be used to represent the internals.  The EDM diagram can be manipulated so that you can do trivial things such as changing a column name reference in the object versus what&#8217;s in the database, to complex things such as consolidating content from tables in order to avoid SQL JOIN expressions.<br /><br />On keynote night the topic of Microsoft &#8220;innovation&#8221; came up and based on what was delivered, it didn&#8217;t seem as though there was much in the way of newness to Microsoft&#8217;s portfolio.  But LINQ in all it&#8217;s forms - for xml, for databases, and for that which implements IEnumerable, this is an innovation indeed.<br /><br />I&#8217;m definitely staying tuned to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/ref/linq/">LINQ project</a> and the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dataaccess/default.aspx">Microsoft Data Access blog</a>.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><p class="MsoNormal">The timelag on posts is due to several 4 hour nights in succession while partaking in the festivities at TechEd.<span style="">  </span>Here is a quick recap of Monday.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">First session was WPF presented by <a href="http://rrelyea.spaces.msn.com/PersonalSpace.aspx">Rob Reylea</a>.<span style="">  </span>WPF seems to be coming together more and more; Rob demonstrated new controls and old controls with new features: the listbox is quite a standout – textboxes that support spellchecking, controls having the ability to embed any other controls (button in a button).<span style="">  </span>Another new feature is in the ability to do screen layout: flow layout, grid layout, and others besides the traditional absolute layout most WinForms developers are used to.<span style="">  </span>Databinding in WPF is also quite improved, and learned from the web world: there is a repeater type approach to it now possible as well as functionality in the new listbox control. Vectors, fonts – there was a lot to the presentation.<span style="">  </span>Rob has a blog, so it’s something to watch as the WPF things consolidate more.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">After the session was finished I asked Rob whether they were watching other projects like Mozilla’s XUL/XPFE stuff since, in my own thinking, they were similar in approach.<span style="">  </span>He was a bit dismissive here in the sense that he didn’t see why WPF and XPFE should be compared.<span style="">  </span>Since we didn’t have the same assumptions, I withdrew the question although here is my own thinking: </p>  <ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="1" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal" style="">XAML      is like XUL, both are a special markup for describing presentation. </li><li class="MsoNormal" style="">XPCOM      provides hooks into the operating system functionality, making the client      thick just the way that Windows Vista is going to have a special      understanding and capability with XAML and the code associated with WPF      applications.<o:p><br /></o:p></li></ol>    <p class="MsoNormal">There are some big differences for sure: XPFE uses javascript and CSS, WPF does not.<span style="">  </span>XPFE relies on RDF, and I’m not sure that they’ll be any configuration involved in WPF applications since the runtime should handle much of that for the developer.<span style="">  </span>I am not sure about this.  Another set of differences are the vectors and rendering of WPF - XPFE does not, to my knowledge, have an equivalent.  However, the basis for my assumption was that they both attempt at solving similar problems - extend the web aware application to the desktop to give it a more &#8220;client app&#8221; functionality and feel.  Leverage better controls and have more flexibility than HTML/DHTML and so on.  And yes, this is from the perspective of WPF/e - the use in web based applications.<br /></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">There is much to learn, and much to be seen of WPF, I’ll stay tuned to Rob’s and other blogs that follow the development.</p>  <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I’d been looking forward to the keynote for a while since I found out that Ray Ozzie was going to be speaking. Unfortunately his piece of things was quite small – I imagine I wasn’t the only person disappointed by this.  The meaning of the keynote was the general direction and strategy of Microsoft and how we “IT people” fit into that.<br /><br />It made me think a lot of Macintosh ads and how differentiated the corporate strategies of  Microsoft and Apple differ.  Microsoft has taken the rather difficult (and not necessarily sexy (in a geek sense)) undertaking of “people-centric” software for business.  The idea is to make people more productive in an organizational setting with software.<br /><br />This reminds me of Paul Graham’s evocation of young people to pick hard problems to work on.  The word “hard” is subject to semantic lashing but in this case, the idea of making people work better together is a very difficult problem, especially because it’s difficult to do without reinventing the wheel and causing new problems with current fixes.<br /><br />Although it’s not explicitly stated, it seems that Microsoft’s approach here is not to “innovate” necessarily, but to commoditize new technologies that are proving themselves and package them for masses at all levels: masses in systems administration, masses in development, and, of course, the “mass” of society.<br /><br />One other thing about Ozzie’s keynote: there is now a conversation about “smart client” applications which represent something that I began to suspect when I first installed Google Earth: the possibility of leveraging a thick client that was intensely web aware.  Of course this notion has been around for a long time – yes, I do play MMOs on occasion – but now a technology like that could possibly be commoditized by Microsoft moving developers away from the traditional web based application to a more controlled, powerful “experience” the developer can produce.  Web applications still have their place but essentially the XAML WPF/e notion. Kind of cool in the sense that fewer “fix the back button” types of issues in an internal web based application are possible but also a bit sinister since this is a big move away from “standards” to the proprietary, Windows choke-hold environment.<br /><br />Lots of other thoughts, and some larger context as TechEd gets underway.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />One thing I&#8217;m very interested in hearing about at TechEd is going to be the <a href="http://atlas.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabid=47">Microsoft Atlas </a>framework.  Ajax is haute couture and Atlas seems to be at the center of Microsoft&#8217;s strategy.  On my current project I took a look at using Atlas but never really &#8220;got&#8221; the benefits of the technology.  The declarative side of things seems to be designed for the IDE, and without the IDE here it&#8217;s a bit of a non-intuitive hassle to hand code things out.   The second thing that made me leary was the direction Atlas took towards web services.  The tasks I needed to perform were very simple and I shuddered when I thought about how much overhead there would be, say, for a webservice whose only job was to send me a filtered list of things for a dropdown.  In the end I used my own XmlHttp and a bit of POX (I love that acronym, &#8220;Plain Old XML&#8221;) to send things back and forth.  Also courtesy of the O&#8217;Reilly <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/ajaxhks/index.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ajax Hacks</span></a> book I got a handle on <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> and how awesome it is when it comes to sending things from the server and handling it with client side javascript. <br /><br />Today I listened to <a href="http://dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showID=177">Ken Alstad</a> interviewed on <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com">.NET Rocks</a> concerning Atlas and it confirmed my suspicions on Atlas leveraging web services and how easy it was to &#8220;bind&#8221; data from the server using javascript.<br /><br />It&#8217;s interesting that there seem to be two directions here - looking on the open source side of things, <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/">Prototype</a> seems to be generating quite a buzz.  I ran into Prototype in December courtesy of <a href="http://www.24ways.org/">24 ways</a> and it took about 35 minutes to really &#8220;get&#8221; it.  Prototype is getting mixed in with a lot of JSON and other javascript libraries and techniques for some pretty cool stuff like script.aculo.us. <br /><br />On the Microsoft side we&#8217;re waiting for Atlas to become standardized, complete, (marketable?).  It&#8217;s declarative, more IDE friendly it seems, and at least for me, less intuitive.<br /><br />Anyway, part of the problem might be my ability to understand it and see where I can leverage it so I&#8217;m going to be in <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/Weblogs/CategoryView,category,Jeff%20Prosise.aspx">Jeff Prosise&#8217;s</a> session on Atlas at TechEd. A few questions I&#8217;m thinking of are as follows:<br /><br />1. How to control when data is bound, doing filtering and other operations using javsacript.<br />2. Will Atlas play well with JSON?  Not JSON being shoehorned into some Atlas app, but more like the ability to return JSON style strings from the server.<br />3. What sort of IDE interface can we expect with Atlas&#8217;s release?  Can we expect any improvements to javascript editing in Visual Studio as a result?<br /><br />&#8230; I&#8217;m sure there are more, and I&#8217;m sure that after the session I&#8217;ll have a much clearer picture of Atlas and it&#8217;s future in web apps for Microsoft developers.  I am pretty sure we made the right choice on the current project, but a year from now I could be singing praises for Atlas.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I&#8217;ve just got to Jack W. Reeves thoughts on <a href="http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design_main.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Code as Design</span></a> in his seminal article originally in the now defunct <span style="font-style: italic;">C++ Journal</span>, and now republished on <a href="http://www.developerdotstar.com/"><span style="font-style: italic;">developer.*</span></a>.  I really liked his thoughts and although I can&#8217;t necessarily say it&#8217;s been something intuitively sitting in the back of my mind, its implications are definitely something I&#8217;ve thought for a very long time.<br /><br />The basic premise of his article is stated early: <span style="font-weight: bold;">final source code is the real software design</span>.  From the source code design specification, a compiler and linker do the manufacturing work to implement the software from what one could term the design document of source code.  He continues to discuss some implications of this that are well thought out and, from my experience, very true.<br /><br />A great thing about the article is the return to the notion of engineering and software development being treated together.  These days I see a lot of writing about how the words software and engineering could never go together, but as Reeves shows, there is a very real relationship between disciplines especially if we think of our code as a design document.<br /><br />But the real implication for me, beyond the ones stated by Reeves, has to do with the title &#8220;Software Architect&#8221; - which I happen to hold (not overly meaningful, by the way - everyone at my company is a &#8220;Software Architect&#8221;).  People with the title, who wield Visio, Use Cases, and management-speak <span style="font-style: italic;">exclusively</span>, aren&#8217;t the real architects of the system.  Of course these tools are very useful, and of course general direction is always necessary for a project, but for the notion of a real &#8220;Software Architect&#8221; one has to stay close to the code - close to the actual design document - to really shape the manufacturing process.  Although staying close doesn&#8217;t mean, to me, writing every line of code oneself, it means understanding and being a part of the process of making it.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
