<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />Joel is at it again. In his most recent essay, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/DevelopmentAbstraction.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Development Abstraction Layer</span></a>, he asserts that management at a software company should build an &#8220;abstraction layer&#8221; that eliminates all distractions from the programmers except programming. Programmers are to be cushioned in the best environment possible to think:<br /><br /><blockquote>A programmer is most productive with a quiet private office, a great computer, unlimited beverages, an ambient temperature between 68 and 72 degrees (F), no glare on the screen, a chair that&#8217;s so comfortable you don&#8217;t feel it, an administrator that&#8230;<br /></blockquote><br />Okay stop Joel!  That is the perfection that I dream of but have yet to really be placed into.  In a different thread, however, I get my answer as to why:<br /><br /><blockquote>But of course, it really depends on where you are in the foodchain. For Developers, I&#8217;ve always considered it to be:<br /><br />Bottom - Coroporate IT Department Developers. Developers are a cost center<br /><br />Middle - Internet Company. Developers are part of the core business strategy.<br /><br />Top - Shrinkwrap Vendors. Developers are the profit center.</blockquote>Generally speaking this seems to be true.  Because my experience has primarily to do with corporate environments, there is a vast difference between that programmer experience and that of, say, your average programmer at Google.<br /><br />My current employer is good to us, however - most of that seems to come from the fact that the principal is himself a programmer.  As a result we have excellent hardware, software, beverages, chairs, and reading material.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />Toby Segaran, of <a href="http://www.tasktoy.com/">Lazybase</a> and <a href="http://www.tasktoy.com/">tasktoy</a> fame, <a href="http://blog.kiwitobes.com/70">recently emitted</a> the following on motivation:<br /><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>&#8220;The truth is that I don&#8217;t make any money from these applications. They were never intended to be a business. I wrote them because I wanted them, it was an opportunity to learn something new, and like most people I love creating things. I determined that for less than I spend on coffee, I could put them online and share them with everyone.&#8221;</blockquote>In a recent conversation with a person from work I spoke about <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/paper">an idea</a> for RSS aggregation I had that would be different from current tools but make for better use.  As cool as it was, I said, I doubted I could build a business model around it. When it was suggested I came up with the thought as a way of making money, it gave me pause -<br /><br />Not really, not at all, in fact. Things I write like <a href="http://www.t3rse.com/builder/">iTunesBuilder</a>, <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/antipod">antiPod</a>, <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/pwd">Hobbitwerk:::pwd</a>, <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/pi.aspx">Hobbitwerk::PIdigit</a>, <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/phoDak">phoDak</a> all had some personal problem or interest that prompted me to make them.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pekka_Himanen">Pekka Himanen&#8217;s</a> book, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Hacker Ethic</span>, does well on this note by giving &#8220;Hacker&#8221; culture three main attributes (from Wikipedia, I&#8217;d suggest you actually read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/037575878X/sr=8-2/qid=1145722288/ref=sr_1_2/102-2569210-1553713?%5Fencoding=UTF8">the book</a>):<br /><blockquote>1. enthusiasm, passion about work that is enjoyed<br /><br />2. creativity, wish to realize oneself and one&#8217;s ability, often in teams that are formed spontaneously (project orientation)<br /><br />3. wish to share one&#8217;s skills with a community having common goals, along with the need to acquire recognition from one&#8217;s &#8220;tribe&#8221;; one is motivated by inner zeal rather than external awards: the fruits of one&#8217;s work are donated to everybody for their advances and further developments</blockquote>I would scarcely deign to mention myself in the same sentence as guys like Linus Torvalds or Toby Segaran, I understand this a lot from the stuff that I am trying to do. I&#8217;m hoping one of these days to have a good enough idea to make a contribution to programmers and people who use software.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">}</span> </span></div>

I have a flat file with multiple lines that belong to one person account and i need to bring all lines to one line making them as one line of comma separate type data. For example as below:<BR/>DateIn&#8221; 2007/01/01 account:155555<BR/>name&#8221; john smith Age: 18<BR/>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<BR/>DateIn&#8221; 2007/01/01 account:166665<BR/>name&#8221; josh sammy Age: 20<BR/><BR/>With this example, how can i join the 2 lines to one line then i join the final 2 lines in one line.  By the way, i have been trying to work on this in my sql server 2000.<BR/><BR/>Thanks,<BR/><BR/>ME2007.</div>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I first got this vibe from Jason Freid of <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37 Signals</a> while listening to a podcast from <a href="http://www.venturevoice.com/">Venture Voice</a> (I&#8217;m not that into VV; it&#8217;s a bit too &#8220;MBA&#8221; for my more technical tastes - I found msyelf there only because Joel Spolsky was interviewed).<br /><br />This is by recollection but he spoke of simple tools designed to do a single thing well.   Now, a few months out from that I see the following on <a href="http://noisebetweenstations.com/personal/weblogs/?p=1855">Noise Between Stations</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>Robust tools are seductive, but their complexity quickly results in diminishing returns. Adopt tools with as many features as you need, and no more. Usually a few essential features will enable you to do many things well.</blockquote>Interesting and thought provoking.   One thing I&#8217;d add is to have tools that let you do things fast and terse.  What about a class designer for Visual Studio that let you design a class skeleton with as little as the following:<br /><br />class Person:<br />p string FirstName<br />p string LastName<br />p int ID<br />m DoSomething(int paramA, string paramB)<br />m DoSomethingElse(string[] p, ArrayList p2)<br />language C#<br /><br />would emit:<br /><br />public class Person{<br /> private string m_FirstName;<br /> private string m_LastName;<br /> private int m_ID;<br /> public string FirstName{<br />   get{<br />    return m_FirstName;<br />  }<br />   set{<br />    m_FirstName = value;<br />  }<br /> }<br />    // and so on<br />}<br /><br /><br />The challenge of something like that would be leveraging plain text without becoming too esoteric.  I would have assumed a lot of tools that would automate things like this but Visual Studio 2005&#8217;s &#8220;class diagram&#8221; tool seems to disprove that.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />Apparently there is an <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1178.html">RFC on naming conventions</a>! Here is <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.304104.29">the thread</a> is on JoS. Gadgetopia also had a <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/4608">thread</a> concerning the naming of things.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve always liked more creative naming conventions, even though an argument can be made for the sensible but boring &#8220;Computer01&#8221;&#8230; type approach. <br /><br />My machines were named after places in Middle Earth, like Minas Tirith and Isengard.  Pretty soon I&#8217;m going to have to clean things up and the new names will probably have some vague reference to Neal Stephenson (Raven, Hiro, Ng, &#8230;). But that&#8217;s probably something hard to explain to the Judy in accounting types.<br /><br />I&#8217;m glad scientists and discoverers are creative with their names.  The solar system, our human anatomy, different species, all are named well, and not &#8220;XXX01&#8221;, &#8220;XXX02&#8221;, &#8220;XXX03.&#8221;<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />Eric Sink of <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/">SourceGear</a> has an article, <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://software.ericsink.com/articles/Yours_Mine_Ours.html">Yours, Mine, and Ours</a>, about writing software that other people use.  Over the years I&#8217;ve noticed that massive chasm in the &#8220;personal&#8221; software developers write for themselves and the software that people actually find useful.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve written lots of simple utilities for myself but it&#8217;s been ever so rare that I&#8217;ve made something that other people find useful.  Perhaps my biggest flop in this was an online link database that I had hoped my friends would jump in on and use to spread and keep those funny, cool, and useful snippets of the web that we are constantly emailing and instant messaging to each other.<br /><br />I still use the utility (it&#8217;s proven quite useful to me), but after a few logins from friends it died as a &#8220;public&#8221; tool. I haven&#8217;t talked much to people about it but here&#8217;s a few reasons I think they didn&#8217;t like it:<br /><br />>> It required login/registration. <br />Even though they were my friends, no one seems to be looking for Yet Another Password Website.  Worse yet, I required an email address thinking in future I&#8217;d createa  mail list with all the links that had been recently submitted.<br /><br />>> It was buggy.<br />There were a few things I knew it had problems with.  It&#8217;s embarrassing to say but there was one area where I did a database insert by manually constructing the &#8220;INSERT&#8230; &#8221; and therefore if any content had an apostrophe, it would break.  As non-developers they all didn&#8217;t have time to hear the reason why it broke, I think most, after one error just never came back.<br /><br />>> It didn&#8217;t organize well.<br />I figured out a way to organize things that worked for me personally but never got outside input for how things worked.<br /><br />>> I wasn&#8217;t the best evangelist<br />I did fix some of the bugs, and even though it got a bit better I didn&#8217;t really know who to tell. So apart from some close friends who tried it and left, it lived in isolation.<br /><br />>> The URL sucked<br />It was an offshoot of my main site, easy for me to remember, but a big pain for other people.<br /><br />So anyhow, Eric&#8217;s essay resonated with me.  I&#8217;ve got some &#8220;new&#8221; personal projects that I am really hopeful will become Usware.  The thing that I find encouragement in is that with each new piece of software I write in my spare time, things get a little better and a little smoother when I show them to other people.  Oh, and I&#8217;m better at keeping my mouth shut until it&#8217;s actually working.<br /><br />My big questions for public consumption are what other deliberate steps one can take away from Meware to Usware, especially with the limited resources of an individual?  Or are there any good stories of strategies used to transport Meware to Usware?<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

<span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">{</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="">Joel Spolsky, software pundit of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel On Software</a> is writing a series of articles on &#8220;Great Design.&#8221;  In his most <a target="_blank" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/design/1stDraft/02.html">recent article draft</a> he talks about &#8220;star&#8221; products  - his examples include Brad Pitt, the iPod, and the Herman Miller Aeron.<br /><br />Here is my short rebuttle, not because I think he&#8217;s wrong, but because I think sometimes good design is boring as ever:<br /></span></span><br />>> It&#8217;s interesting how iPods and Aerons always come up when it comes to &#8220;good design&#8221; but no one is crazy enough to talk about Wal Mart and design. <br /><br />Joel asserted as much himself in his previous article describing design that as a discipline it&#8217;s focuses on a lot more than the aesthetic. <br /><br />But one of the things that is impressive to me about good design is invisibility. <br /><br />Wal-Mart is a perfect, but scandalous example of this.  No one wants to bring them up because it&#8217;s not as chic as, say, an iPod, but when we are honest with ourselves it seems as though this &#8220;proletariet&#8221; design seems to contact us more than something like an Aeron chair.<br /><br />How fashionable is it to talk about the design of throw aways, or the design of &#8220;just good enough?&#8221;  I think Visual Basic and Wal-Mart have a lot in common: they touch *everyone* (have a look at the POS (no pun intended) system at the next store you visit and chances are it was written in VB), but they don&#8217;t jump to the front of one&#8217;s mind when they think of (capital D) Design.<br /><br />Is the Wal Mart throwaway an excellent example of design? <br /><br />Okay, how about this for a change of direction. What car do people pick out of a crowd for &#8220;great (capital D) Design?&#8221;  Audi? BMW?  But what car silently makes the profits of these vehicles like chump change (some boring car that *everyone&#8217;s* got, like a Honda Civic).  By design? <<<br /><br />What is to be said of throwaways and invisible design?<br /><br />I&#8217;m sure people are going to respond to my post <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.302070.0">here</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">}</span></span></div>
