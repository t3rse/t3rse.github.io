<span style="font-size:180%;">{</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><em>Ruby on Rails</em> is getting more and more buzz each time I open my browser.  This time it was Bruce Tate </span><a href="www.zeldman.com/daily/1005i.shtml"><span style="font-size:85%;">claiming</span></a><span style="font-size:85%;"> that <em>Java</em> is dead (&#8220;like <em>COBOL</em>, not Elvis&#8221;) and that he was turning to <em>Ruby on Rails</em> as his framework for application development.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">A few days ago I also noticed a </span><a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/10/13/what_is_rails.html"><span style="font-size:85%;">define/tutorial</span></a><span style="font-size:85%;"> on <em>Ruby on Rails</em> over at <em>O&#8217;Reilly</em>.  More and more of these seem to be popping up of late.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">The most interesting thing about this buzz, however, seems to be the shift in the pendulum swing to a language that is light and airy, one which isn&#8217;t belabored by the stiffness of strong types.  </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">I remember the process of learning <em>Java</em> - there seemed to be a lot of people coming from a <em>C/C++ </em>background who perpetually scowled at the <em>VB/Microsoft/Webby/Scripter</em> types like me.  Now many of this camp are turning away from that rigidity and heading back to the land of &#8220;dynamic&#8221; typing.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Pendulum swing&#8230; a few days ago I met with a prospective client and they showed me an app they were using that was written in <em>PowerBuilder</em>.  I don&#8217;t know much about <em>PowerBuilder</em> but the app seemed quick, flexible, and tightly coupled with the database.  What&#8217;s most ironic is that the reason I was there was to help with stored procedures and triggers that would let them add business logic to the otherwise light and airy environment in which their application came into being.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Deja vu, all over again.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">I&#8217;ve got <em>Ruby on Rails</em> on my watch list.  Go to the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">official website</a> and there&#8217;s even a movie amongst the tutorials.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;">}</span></div>

House rejects bill to exempt Internet from campaign-finance rules<BR/>There&#8217;s broad agreement among Democrats and Republicans that the Internet writings of political bloggers shouldn&#8217;t be tangled in complex federal campaign-finance regulations.<BR/>Hi, I was just blog surfing and found you!

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#000099;">{</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">I&#8217;ve been doing web development for a long time.  Long enough to have developed lots of patterns and habits for how I&#8217;d approach putting together a website.  Because most of my work is done with server side code, I&#8217;ve also yielded most layout thinking to the Panels, Grids, and User Controls I create in ASP.NET.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">So it&#8217;s a bit of a surprise now that I find that my habits are wrong, horrid even when it comes to web development.  My effortlessly thinking in tables goes against the grain of any CSS ideologies out there. Having just redesigned <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net">my personal site</a>, this is a bit of a drag.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">As I read up on layouts with CSS, it&#8217;s funny to see things turned back on themselves: </span><br /><ul><li><span style="font-size:85%;">Absolute Positioning - I used to tell everyone to avoid this because of different screen resolutions</span></li><li><span style="font-size:85%;">ul/li tags - Which were so passe, and used as an example of the obscure tags one didn&#8217;t need anymore.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:85%;">Tables - frown upon for anything other than displaying tabular data. Read: no layouts, thank you.</span></li></ul><span style="font-size:85%;">So I&#8217;m beefing up again. I need to learn the particular advantages of these newer layout strategies - after messing around today a bit I don&#8217;t seem to gain anything over my older methods.  I&#8217;m sure this will change.  </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">I did some surfing and checked out various sites&#8230; most of them are using DIVs and CSS for layout, not tables.  Curiously, </span><a href="http://picks.yahoo.com"><span style="font-size:85%;">Yahoo! Picks</span></a><span style="font-size:85%;"> is one site that seems to have kept things the way they were.  </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#000099;">}</span></div>

<span style="font-size:180%;color:#000099;">{</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">One of our clients has a Microsoft SQL Server table with 284 fields. So when I&#8217;m given a spec that references the &#8220;OrigLoanAmount&#8221; field, it&#8217;s sometimes difficult to ascertain where that field lives. On some systems, especially if you&#8217;ve got familiarity where data are likely to be stored, you can make an educated guess. But if you&#8217;re interested in some quick digging, try these queries from the Information Schema views:</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;color:#33cc00;">&#8211; find that elusive column</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">SELECT * FROM Information_Schema.Columns WHERE Column_Name LIKE &#8216;%MyColumn%&#8217;</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;color:#33cc00;">&#8211; list out the tables</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">SELECT * FROM Information_Schema.Tables</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">For procedures, views, and functions, I&#8217;ve just queried sysobjects. I learned this from a guy who was in my class once; I used to be one of the hapless Enterprise Manager users until I saw him digging effortlessly with queries like:</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;color:#33cc00;">&#8211; show me all stored procedures</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">SELECT * FROM syobjects WHERE type = &#8216;p&#8217; AND name NOT LIKE &#8216;dt%&#8217;</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;color:#33cc00;">&#8211; show me all views </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">SELECT * FROM sysobjects WHERE type=&#8217;v&#8217;</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;color:#33cc00;">&#8211; show me all user defined functions</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">SELECT * FROM sysobjects WHERE type=&#8217;FN&#8217; </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">&#8230; and so on. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#000099;">}</span></div>

The instructions are clear; run the <em>register.bat</em> from the VS.NET command prompt. After that you can make a reference to the application interop assembly of your choice, such as Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.dll.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Reference the namespace in your app:<br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">using Excel = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel;</span></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Code away:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;color:#ff0000;">Excel.Application app = new Excel.Application();<br />Excel.Workbook book = app.Workbooks.Open(@&#8221;c:\data\Daita.xls&#8221;,Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing,<br />Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing,<br />Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing, Type.Missing,<br />Type.Missing, Type.Missing);<br />Excel.Worksheet sheet = (Excel.Worksheet)book.Worksheets[1];<br />for(int i=1;i<10;i++) j="1;j<7;j++)" rg =" (Excel.Range)sheet.Cells[i,j];"><br /><br /><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:85%;">A few interesting things:</span><br /></span><ul><li><span style="font-size:85%;color:#000000;">The Type.Missing passed for all those COM-esque optional parameters.

I stressed the importance of understanding Delegates here, and did a quick example of what I meant which you can download in a different project, <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/vbDel.zip">vbDel</a>. If you don&#8217;t mind looking at C#, you can look at some earlier entries I made about how delegates work. One of the best uses of delegates is to make an asynchronous call to any method you&#8217;ve written. Asynchronous delegates are how asynchronous web service calls are implemented.<br /><br />The fake SAX Parser we wrote is also in the project, in its own file called<span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0);"> SAXP.vb</span>. It is not very complete but should give you an idea of how to get the SAX functionality out of the .NET Framework. If you&#8217;d ever want to – that&#8217;s probably a remote possibility.<br /><br />The <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">WriteXML()</span> method is a very basic example of how you can use the XmlTextWriter to create XML documents. This isn&#8217;t too interesting, but if you start to combine the XmlTextReader and the XmlTextWriter, you can start to see the power and ease of the .NET APIs. In the second group, we wrote some code that would convert an attribute based document into an element based one. You will find this in a method called <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">AttToElement()</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:100%;" >Transforming</span><br /><br />The <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">SimpleTransform()</span> method is an example of the simplest form of XSLT Transformations that can be done with the .NET Framework. Another method, called <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;">MemoryTransform()</span>, is an example of how transformation can be done and processed in memory to return results in a string format. You will notice the use of the MemoryStream class in this example.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:100%;" >Serialization</span><br /><br />We took two different looks at serialization. In the first we looked at how a built in class, the DataSet, has the ability to persist itself in XML format. Our method <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;">PersistDataSet()</span> shows an example of this.  In order to demonstrate the retrieval of a persisted DataSet, we wrote another method called <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;">ReadPersistedDataSet()</span>. Along the way we talked about the Schema options of the WriteXml method of the DataSet. Although it was a barely noticeable blurb, make sure you investigate the XmlDataDocument class. It&#8217;s a quick way to go from a DataSet to an XML Dom-like object and back again.<br /><br />Once we&#8217;d seen that type of persistence, we looked at conventional serialization, or being able to take any old class and serialize it into some output stream. We wrote the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">PersistConventional()</span> method to display this functionality with a class called Person, and then we depersisted in a method called <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;">DepersistConventional()</span>.<br /><br />This was a good way to start working at understanding web services. I&#8217;ll make another entry with the web services demos, but really quickly, the last few examples related to XML and .NET:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:100%;" >XML and SQL Server 2000</span><br /><br />We looked at ways to retrieve XML data from the database, and I demonstrated the FOR XML clause of an sql statement. After we looked at a few examples, we wrote the <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;">GetXMLFromDB()</span> method that would issue a FOR XML query and return results using the XmlReader. Which left us with one other thing on our &#8220;to do&#8221; list: inserting XML data into SQL Server directly.<br /><br />In the project you will find a file called OPENXML.sql. This file contains a series of scripts to work through to understand how one can use the OPENXML function in SQL Server 2000 to build a &#8220;rowset&#8221; view on an XML document. Once this rowset functionality is understood, it&#8217;s easy to see how it can be combined with Insert/Select statements to insert data. This is demonstrated in the <span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;">InsertXMLContent()</span> method.<br /><br />So that was the <span style="font-style: italic;">tour de force</span>.  You can download it all in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/nsBasic.zip">this zipped project</a>.  If you have questions, don&#8217;t hesitate to email me.  </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">}</span></span></div>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Generated during class with South Dakota State employees but hopefully useful to anyone who wanders this way.<br /><br />[<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">NOTE: My web host doesn&#8217;t serve the *.java files, so download the zipfile at the end of this post instead. I&#8217;ll rename with *.txt later.</span>]<br /><br />We began things with a Hello World program in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Hello.java">Hello.java</a>. Soon after we talked about defining classes, the basic building block of any java program. <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Clerk.java">Clerk.java</a> shows an example of a class with fields, methods, getters and setters (accessor methods), and a constructor. Along the way we also learned about overloading, as seen in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Calculator.java">Calculator.java</a>.<br /><br />We learned more details about class definitions: <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Clock.java">Clock.java</a> (check with <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/TestClock.java">TestClock.java</a>) and <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Employee.java">Employee.java</a> are examples of how you can chain constructors. <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/BankAccount.java">BankAccount.java</a> was used to show the difference between static and instance methods and fields.  You can see the BankAccount class tested in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Thursday.java">Thursday.java</a>.  Once we were comfortable with the static keyword, we talked about defining constants, using <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Constants.java">Constants.java</a> as our example.<br /><br />We had a chapter that covered arrays, in which we looked at <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/UsingArrays.java">UsingArrays.java</a>. I added an aside about Collection classes in java, which are a more robust alternative to arrays in most cases, and we looked at <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Swapmeet.java">Swapmeet.java</a>. Even though I got the bubble sort wrong in class, it&#8217;s fixed in this example with some helper methods, sortMyArray and printArray. We looked at working with Calendars and dates in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/TestBed.java">TestBed.java</a>.  I also included a <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/DateDiff.java">DateDiff.java</a> that shows how to get the functionality of a basic DateDiff command.  Like other things, it&#8217;s ugly in java.<br /><br />You saw one class from the swing library, the JOptionPane, which was used to talk about getting user input. I also showed you the BufferedReader along with it in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Dialoging.java">Dialoging.java</a>. I would recommend the BufferedReader approach if your application runs from the command line, personally. For most other examples in class, we used <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/EasyConsole.java">EasyConsole.java</a>, which abstracted reading and writing from the console with a few simple methods.<br /><br />At this point we began to cover inheritance.  We looked at a basic inheritance heirarchy in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Person.java">Person.java</a>, <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/InhEmployee.java">InhEmployee.java</a>, and <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Executive.java">Executive.java</a>.  We looked at abstract classes in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Shape.java">Shape.java </a>and we briefly looked at interfaces in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/IPrintable.java">IPrintable.java</a>.<br /><br />We closed out with the basics of exception handlers and subclassing exception. The try{..}catch{&#8230;}finally{&#8230;} is probably best introduced by your material.<br /><br />Our final two topics were File I/O and parsing XML documents.  On the File I/O side, I had two classes: <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/DavidFileReader.java">DavidFileReader.java</a> to demonstrate methods of reading from a file stream, and <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/DavidFileWriter.java">DavidFileWriter.java</a>, to demonstrate writing to a file stream.  In terms of XML, I have a class called <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Xreader.java">Xreader.java</a> which should help you get started parsing XML files.<br /><br />Wow, that was a lot for three days. Even typing it out makes me tired. In regards to the samples, you can download them individually, or you can <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Classfiles.zip">download a zip archive</a> of the entire set.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />So I am still coming to terms with how <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> works, and trying to get the &#8220;philosophy&#8221; behind its organization system. My understanding is this: iTunes can scour the hard drive, if you allow it, and maintain a nice library of tracks, no matter where on your physical disk they are located. You can then sift through by artist, etc&#8230;<br /><br />In my case I have ~30 GB of music and much of it isn&#8217;t in mp3 files with ID3 tags - I&#8217;ve got a pot pourri of mixes and a ton of podcasts I&#8217;ve been listening to while I work. It&#8217;s too much of a pain to manually create a playlist for all the folders or try to find unlabeled music in the library. Maybe it&#8217;s because of winamp but I&#8217;m used to organizing my music physically, and then grabbing tracks out of a directory that I want to play, rather than by &#8220;artist&#8221; or &#8220;genre.&#8221; For example, I&#8217;ve got the following:<br /><br />-/Mp3<br />&#8212;-/PodCast<br />  &#8212;&#8212;&#8211;/ITConversations<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;/KCRW<br />  &#8212;&#8212;&#8211;&#8230; and so on<br /> &#8212;-/Albums<br />  &#8212;&#8212;&#8211;/Interpol<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;    /Massive Attack<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;    &#8230; and so on<br />&#8212;-/Mixes<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;    /Jan2005<br />  &#8212;&#8212;&#8211;/Feb2005<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;    /Mar2005<br />  &#8212;&#8212;&#8211;&#8230; and so on<br /><br />This scheme works well, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to mesh with iTunes. So I wrote a little program using the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/sdk/itunescomsdk.html">iTunes COM SDK</a> that takes a directory as a parameter and automatically creates a playlist for each folder that contains mp3 or other music files. In my case it worked perfectly (took seconds!) in creating playlists for all my folders and the files they contained. I put in a &#8220;Sync&#8221; button too, so it can synchronize with changes you make to file structure.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/iTunesBuilder.gif" /><br /><br />I&#8217;ve uploaded a <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/iTunesBuilder.zip">*.zip</a> along with source (it&#8217;s written in VB6). I tested it with iTunes 4.7 and it works fine. I&#8217;m not sure whether this was unnecessary; perhaps iTunes has an option for doing just this, I don&#8217;t know. But more deeply, I think, is an attitude, an approach of giving the user an interaction with a piece of software.  In the PC world, one spends a lot more time &#8220;organizing&#8221; things than does on one on a Mac.  I&#8217;ve heard and read often that systems should be able to manage themselves but find myself balking at the notion that the system can do as good of a job as I can.  I download faster than I listen, so things must be organized, but the content of the audio is the archival attribute, not the date, artist, or genre.  How this can be known outside of the user, I&#8217;m not sure.<br /><br />If you do make a modification, or an improvement (many probably could be made), let me know. I&#8217;m also unaware of any <span style="font-style: italic;">plug-in</span> architecture for iTunes, otherwise I&#8217;d try to just make it a couple of buttons or menu items in the program itself.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

I have the exact same problem. I always order my music by directories and such instead of proprietary metadata. Instead of creating playlists (which will limit the solution to iTunes) my idea is to fix the id3 tags so that they include track-numbering. (That way it will work with Muine, Rhythmbox, etc.) Unfortunately WinAmp and XMMS are the only players I know that can sort by filename.<BR/><BR/>I&#8217;m working on a Ruby solution. Check http://philisha.net in a few weeks.<BR/><BR/>As for which way of organization is superior, I think there is something to be said for the iTunes way. Organizing a 30GB collection of music is a rather mundane task; you shouldn&#8217;t HAVE to do it manually.<BR/><BR/>Unfortunately, the iTunes way really only works if you&#8217;ve been using iTunes from the start and if you don&#8217;t use your music library on other players. So it&#8217;s nice in theory, but I think I&#8217;ll still spend an unfortunate amount of time managing stuff myself.</div>
