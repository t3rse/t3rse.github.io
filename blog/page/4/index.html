  <div class="entry-content"><p>There was a time in my life when I daydreamed about being at a startup, eating pizza, and writing code while I worked the kind of hours that would be daunting for a Foxconn factory worker. Although this period of my life predates the <a href="http://paulgraham.com/" target="_blank">Paul Graham</a> / <a href="http://ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">YCombinator</a> era (it all started with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0887308554/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0887308554&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=t3rse-20">Accidental Empires</a><img style="border-bottom-style: none !important; margin: 0px; border-left-style: none !important; border-top-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=t3rse-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0887308554" width="1" height="1" /> ), PG and the YCombinator stories are a part of internet lore much in the same way that <a href="http://www.folklore.org/index.py" target="_blank">the stories of Apple</a> captured an earlier generation’s imagination. </p>  <p>Although my life as a husband and father shifts my values and perspectives on the concepts of startups (very cool for other people but the time isn’t right for me), I still like the yarns of what it takes to have an idea and build a company out of it. This was why I tuned in to the Startup School broadcast. </p>  <p>One presentation that stuck with me was <a href="http://david.weebly.com/index.html" target="_blank">David Rusenko</a> of <a href="http://www.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Weebly</a>, a company built around serving people who want an easy, low impact way of building a website. The end of the story is where Weebly is now: vastly successful in terms of revenue, profitability, and pervasiveness – some 2% of active websites on the internet run on their platform. Weebly and his crew lived the dream: a small idea in college with friends, getting funded by YCombinator, living in San Francisco and making it big. They’ve been featured in <em>TechCrunch</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, and&#160; <em>Newsweek</em>, and elsewhere. It’s enough to make the entrepreneurially challenged among us say “that’s so awesome” and miss out on the focal point of Rusenko’s talk - the timeline: </p>  <p>February 2006 – start of coding</p>  <p>August 2006 - 12 new users / friends and family</p>  <p>October 2006 - 30 new users / signups</p>  <p>November 2006 – Getting Techcrunched, a quick spike in user signups</p>  <p>January 2007 - at 11 months, move to san franscisco, less than 100 signups / day, only $100 in bank account</p>  <p>May 2007 - featured in newsweek (15 months in)</p>  <p>August 2007 - featured in Time, 50 best websites, (18 months in), but no “hockey stick” growth</p>  <p>October 2007 - rate of new users signups per day inflection point to positive territory</p>  <p>Fall 2008 – Economic meltdown, tough economy, bank balance going toward 0. </p>  <p>December 2008 - Figuring out what bills to pay, more financial trouble</p>  <p>January 2009 - BREAK EVEN (35 months after starting)</p>  <p>…and now, encouraging the rest of us who aspire that <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html" target="_blank">good software takes a long time to build</a>. </p>  <p><strong>Part 1:</strong></p> <iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/l_b228qEVi8" frameborder="0" width="420" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Part 2: </strong></p> <iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/F90BRJHXsVI" frameborder="0" width="420" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A part of the universal appeal of sport is our ability to see an overlap of beauty and reality within the games we play. The beauty comes from the ideal form, motion, and skill. The reality is the humans at play, the unfortunate circumstance and the ineffables, things like “momentum” or “heart” or “luck.” </p>  <p>While a sport like football (the American variety) is about the goal of perfection, its idealistic opposite is baseball which is consumed with the battle and nuances of failure. The best batters fail 65 percent of the time. An incredible pitching effort can be undone with a late inning meltdown. The difference between the men who are memorable and those who are forgotten is a difference between 1 in 20 at bats[1]. </p>  <p>The nuance of the game extends beyond personal failures and triumph; year after year it seems that teams which end up winning the World Series are teams that “peak at the right time.” Unlike basketball and football, where the better team almost always wins, the better team is only a likely winner in baseball with a lot that is subject to chance. Over the last 5 years, the winners of the World Series <a href="http://www.baseballrealitytour.com/2012/10/so-whats-scenario.html" target="_blank">only win about 60% of their games</a>. In American school 60% is a D – only one point shy of an F.</p>  <p>And somehow this makes me think of life and software. No one wins all the time and depending on the nature of the task, whether the system is closed or open, and the winds of the ineffable (people like Albert Pujols believe in God, not luck, so let’s keep this variable vague), failure is a part of life as a software developer. When a deadline slips, it’s like a strikeout. When a project goes underwater, it’s like losing a series. There are those extended periods of motivational weakness, where bouncing out of bed and compiling code just isn’t that fun. Especially when you work on the same problem for several months (e.g. font rendering). </p>  <p>But like baseball, I think that the difference in people has to do with more than talent. It’s the ability to deal with failure, the grit in hammering away at a problem and persevering, and a temperament that allows you to forget failure and treat the future as its own exciting journey. </p>  <br /><iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/J3ymSA0RqWk" frameborder="0" width="420" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <p>   <br />[1] The difference between batting .250 and .300 (source: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600785875/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1600785875&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=t3rse-20">2012 Baseball Forecaster (Ron Shandler&#8217;s Baseball Forecaster)</a><img style="border-bottom-style: none !important; margin: 0px; border-left-style: none !important; border-top-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=t3rse-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1600785875" width="1" height="1" /> )</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here’s a nice quick solution. Let’s say you have some List&lt;T&gt; and you need to separate it into chunks of some number N or less, for example taking 100 numbers and separating them into batches of 25. </p>  <div class="code">   <pre class="brush: csharp">List&lt;int&gt; myListOfNumbers = Enumerable.Range(1, 100).ToList();

var parted = Enumerable.Range(0, myListOfNumbers.Count)
						.GroupBy(n =&gt; n / 25) // &lt;-- clever sleight of hand here
						.Select(n =&gt; n.Select(index =&gt; myListOfNumbers[index]).ToList());

// prints 1-24, 25-49, 50-74, 75-100
foreach (var part in parted) {
	Debug.WriteLine(String.Join(&quot;,&quot;, part.Select(p =&gt; p.ToString())));
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
  <br />The sleight of hand I’m noting is a neat trick with integer division truncating or flooring values. You can fairly easily generalize this into a method where you pass a List&lt;T&gt; and a parameter for how many items you want in a group.</p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="brush: csharp">Func&lt;List&lt;int&gt;, int, IEnumerable&lt;List&lt;int&gt;&gt;&gt; splitList = (list, groupSize) =&gt; {
	return Enumerable.Range(0, list.Count)
						.GroupBy(n =&gt; n / groupSize) 
						.Select(n =&gt; n.Select(index =&gt; list[index]).ToList());            
};

List&lt;int&gt; primes = new List&lt;int&gt;(){ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 };
var primesGrouped = splitList(primes, 3);</pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Those of us in the C# realm have become so used to LINQ it’s difficult to remember the problems of yesteryear and how we used to solve them. The reason is that almost all of the time, LINQ takes that work we used to do and abstracts a lot of the pain into a query syntax. </p>  <p>But there are some problems things that used to be more intuitive. The dinosaurs among us remember writing code like this:</p>  <div class="code">   <pre class="brush: csharp; ruler: true; first-line: 10; highlight: [2, 4, 6]">void SortRecords(DataTable data, string column, string direction) { 
	data.DefaultView.Sort = String.Join(&quot;{0} {1}&quot;, column, direction); 
} </pre>
</div>

<p>
  <br />In a typical scenario you might have a user click on a column, in some interface and pass that to your SortRecords method to change the way the data is displayed. In the present day, using LINQ to sort is trivial but because LINQ takes expressions as parameters for the typically used OrderBy and OrderByDescending, using a string isn’t as straight forward of a process. What’s a path around this problem? </p>

<p>First, let’s demonstrate the problem. Assume I have a class Person with two properties, FirstName and LastName. Let’s further assume that although an instance of Person is useful, we often have lists of Person that we occasionally find ourselves having to sort. </p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="brush: csharp; ruler: true; first-line: 10; highlight: [2, 4, 6]">var people = new List<person>() { 
        new Person(){ FirstName = &quot;Stan&quot;, LastName = &quot;Lee&quot;}, 
        new Person(){ FirstName = &quot;Jack&quot;, LastName = &quot;Kirby&quot;}, 
        new Person(){ FirstName = &quot;Alex&quot;, LastName = &quot;Ross&quot;},
        new Person(){ FirstName = &quot;Adi&quot;, LastName = &quot;Granov&quot;}
};</pre>
</div>

<p>
  <br />A typical sorting expression in LINQ takes an expression, not a string that could be passed as a parameter. </p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="brush: csharp; ruler: true; first-line: 10; highlight: [2, 4, 6]">var result = people.OrderBy(p =&gt; p.LastName); // not a string</pre>
</div>

<p>
  <br />This creates a problem if you try to generalize sorting into something more reusable like a method or a function. Sure, you could pass an expression, but passing those expressions from the UI can be a little bit tricky. So what course of action? </p>

<p>My solution is to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispatch_table" target="_blank">dispatch table</a>. I first saw the concept back in my days hacking perl but it works in C# with delegates. Here is an example of a dispatch table using strings as keys for our anonymous delegates representing the Linq expression that we would use to sort: </p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="brush: csharp; ruler: true; first-line: 10; highlight: [2, 4, 6]">Dictionary&lt;string, Func&lt;Person, object&gt;&gt; sortLookups = new Dictionary&lt;string, Func&lt;Person, object&gt;&gt;() { 
    {&quot;FirstName&quot;, new Func&lt;Person, object&gt;(p =&gt; p.FirstName)},
    {&quot;LastName&quot;, new Func&lt;Person, object&gt;(p =&gt; p.LastName)}
};</pre>
</div>

<p>
  <br />Now the task of sorting by string is simple because that can be used as the key to reference the correct delegate that would be used as the sort expression. This anonymous method demonstrates the concept: </p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="brush: csharp; ruler: true; first-line: 10; highlight: [2, 4, 6]">IEnumerable&lt;Person&gt; SortThem(string fieldName, IEnumerable&lt;Person&gt; people) {
    Dictionary&lt;string, Func&lt;Person, object&gt;&gt; sortLookups = new Dictionary&lt;string, Func&lt;Person, object&gt;&gt;() { 
        {&quot;FirstName&quot;, new Func&lt;Person, object&gt;(p =&gt; p.FirstName)},
        {&quot;LastName&quot;, new Func&lt;Person, object&gt;(p =&gt; p.LastName)}
    };
    // Q.E.D. really
    return people.OrderBy(sortLookups[fieldName]);
}</pre>
</div>

<p>
  <br />Here is an example of a call to our SortThem method: </p>

<div class="code">
  <pre class="brush: csharp; ruler: true; first-line: 10; highlight: [2, 4, 6]">&gt;
var people = new List<person>() { 
        new Person(){ FirstName = &quot;Stan&quot;, LastName = &quot;Lee&quot;}, 
        new Person(){ FirstName = &quot;Jack&quot;, LastName = &quot;Kirby&quot;}, 
        new Person(){ FirstName = &quot;Alex&quot;, LastName = &quot;Ross&quot;},
        new Person(){ FirstName = &quot;Adi&quot;, LastName = &quot;Granov&quot;}
};
var sortedByLast = SortThem(&quot;LastName&quot;, people);</pre>
</div>

<p>
  <br />Dispatch tables make stringifying method parameters and dealing with LINQ much more palatable since LINQ is all about dealing with expressions. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Once you know how to match up anonymous methods into dispatch tables watch out! You’ll start seeing applications of the technique everywhere!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s remarkable how when one takes into account all the resources that are available for free on the internet, no one has an excuse to make regarding opportunity. I was just recently overwhelmed with a list of <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/6157/list-of-freely-available-physics-books" target="_blank">free physics books</a> that are available on the web. I wondered if that could be combined with something like the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/" target="_blank">physics courses</a> available at MIT Open Courseware for a self driven undergraduate program. Along the way for a little help in snippets, one could watch <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics" target="_blank">Khan Academy physics videos</a>.&#160; There are a lot of online communities one could find help in; the previously referenced <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">Physics StackExchange site</a>, but there are plenty of <a href="http://physicsworld.com/" target="_blank">alternatives</a> and <a href="http://askthephysicist.com/" target="_blank">different formats</a> for interacting with other people trying to learn. </p>  <p>Physics just sprang to mind when I was looking through the free books but it really applies to any field of knowledge. Which makes me wonder: an undergraduate program currently costs somewhere north of $35,000 (per year at some schools). The alternative of trying to figure it out on one’s own costs nothing but has the obstacles of accountability, guidance, and discipline. But not opportunity; it’s all out there. </p>  <p>Full disclosure, I’m taking a look at <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/ocw-scholar/" target="_blank">OCW Scholar</a>. </p></div>

It’s not just that the profession, with a few edge cases, is all but gone – it’s that we see through the modern eye how so much of the work is contrived. The waiting of tables, the polishing of silvers, the staff schedules… it’s rare to find any description of the job that makes sense for a post millennial context.</p>  <p>What keeps me pressing forward, besides the literary craftsmanship of Kazuo Ishiguro in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679731725/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0679731725&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=t3rse-20">The Remains of the Day</a><img style="border-bottom-style: none !important; margin: 0px; border-left-style: none !important; border-top-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=t3rse-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0679731725" width="1" height="1" />, is the thought of how this might relate to my work as a software engineer. Will the web exist a century from now or will all the time and effort put into it be analogous to the butler’s chores around the great houses they maintained for the aristocracy? The answer to me is obvious: everything is subject to change and it’s hard to find it more rampant than in the world of technology. </p>  <p>If the work I do now is as contrived, or, to be more charitable, “of the moment we are in history,” then I would be just as pitiful as the butler if I based too much of my identity in work. Although this is intuitive in a moment of reflection, the web is chock full of “Getting Better” and “Improve Your Game” type fares to which people with my Napoleonic temperament are particularly susceptible. </p>  <p>I keep having to learn a lesson about how the transcendent parts of life are found in relationships; how my moments with my wife or my son are what will persist as “meaningful” if for some reason someone unearths my life, or lives like the one I lived, a century from now. It’s the sad lesson of the butler within the exquisite writing of Kazuo Ishiguro; sad enough that for many people it sits with them long after the conclusion of the book (or movie even though it’s not as good). My sight is set on that even if, on a late night or an early morning, I’m at my computer working hard to try to be better at what I do. </p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.t3rse.com/quigley" target="_blank">Quigley</a> is really simple: it’s a notepad.

Isn’t there one that comes free with my operating system? </strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Quigley runs in your browser </li>    <li>Quigley automatically saves what you type </li>    <li>Quigley let’s you create tabbed notes </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Wait, aren’t there cool products like </strong><a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank"><strong>Evernote</strong></a><strong> that are better?</strong></p>  <p>Trust me: I love Evernote and use it regularly. But there is some ceremony to using it (logging in online, the big client app, the variations between notebooks, entries, and all the sharing possibilities). Quigley is about less; it’s just a scratch space. It’s for the content that you may not care to structure and organize but that you need to remember. A potential freemium feature would be exporting content to Evernote via their API.</p>  <p><strong>T3RSE, are you just trying to make money? </strong></p>  <p>Not really, it’s free and <a href="https://github.com/t3rse/Quigley/" target="_blank">open source</a> although I might add some “freemium” features (in place email, backup, export to Evernote) in the future. I did it mainly to solve a personal problem and I like to write applications entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>  <p>If you have any feature ideas, implementation recommendations let me know!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>   <p>“Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”&#160; - Samuel Beckett</p> </blockquote>  <p>I’ve had a blog of some sort for more than a decade. I started on <a href="http://radio-weblogs.com/0110187/">Userland</a>. I’ve been through most blogging platforms in the .NET space. At some point I started to want to do things my own way, to customize the look, feel, and process of blogging. It culminated in my own attempt at a blog engine. </p>  <p>I learned the hard way that half-hearted attempts at blog engines are not only a <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2012/08/09/why-wordpress/">road to failure</a>, they also mean that every time I had the thought of making a post I’d run into some quirk of my software and be distracted enough to lose the motivation to post. But I never quite got into solving the blogging platform problems because I had other, more interesting projects I wanted to work on. </p>  <p>Hence failure. </p>  <p>But as the world changes around me, as blogs get gobbled up by tweets and tweets get gobbled up by shares, I miss the slower way of doing things. I miss the long blog posts that mean more than a five second scan or a referral link to click. </p>  <p>I’m not only missing out as a consumer, I’m missing out as a producer. I’ve been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Up-Your-Mind-Smarter/dp/185788275X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349305146&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=power+up+your+mind">Power Up Your Mind</a> and one thing that stuck with me is that teaching another person is a great way to really learn something. On one of my old blogs, <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com">Metadeveloper</a>, I spent a lot of time writing at length in technical terms. Not only did my long posts help me understand the things I was explaining in more detail, but over and over I’d find myself searching my own blog for a solved problem I’d documented. </p>  <p>So here is where I try again. No more tinkering with my own blogging software, on this attempt I will use BlogEngine.net and apart from styling and theming, I will keep my tweaks to a minimum. Instead of trying to partition my posts for nontechnical friends and fellow programmers, this is just going to be whatever is on my mind, whatever I’m exploring, or wherever I’m finding some inspiration. </p>  <p>Although I’m not planning on it I will probably fail again. Sometimes life accelerates and it seems like I’ve blinked an eye as a few months have passed. There are times when more important things take center stage. When my son was born my blog and online activity went dark because I was caught between helping my wife and caring for the young one. I don’t regret those moments but I would regret not trying again, and not failing better. </p></div>

<h2><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h2>  <p>It may be easy to miss amidst all the hoopla around Windows 8 but the Norwegian Developers Conference just released all their session vidoes on the site. </p>  <p>It’s been a while since I’ve gotten to go to a conference but the last few I have attended were put on by Microsoft. Although this has advantages in the sense that it coalesces the “experts” of specific Microsoft technologies, many of the presenters work at Microsoft and therefore don’t have a similar problem set that you or I might slogging our way through building products, often with older (read: more “boring”) software. There are also some talks on development techniques like <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/">BDD</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">DDD</a> that are not product specific.</p>  <p>The good thing about NDC is that it seems a lot of the presenters come from an outside perspective so it’s a good balance for a lot of the MIX / PDC type stuff I’ve been watching of late. Without further ado:</p>  <p>Direct Download from NDC website: <a href="http://ndc2011.no/agenda.aspx?cat=1071&amp;id=-1&amp;day=3726">Day 1</a> | <a href="http://ndc2011.no/agenda.aspx?cat=1071&amp;id=-1&amp;day=3727">Day 2</a> | <a href="http://ndc2011.no/agenda.aspx?cat=1071&amp;id=-1&amp;day=3728">Day 3</a></p>  <p><a href="http://goo.gl/IKrBh">Roy Osherove’s “unofficial” torrent</a></p>  <h2><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h2>  </div>

<h2><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h2>  <p>Many moons ago I got about <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmans2007UltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolListForWindows.aspx">0.25 seconds of fame</a> when <a href="http://www.nregex.com">nRegex</a>, a tool I wrote for evaluating regular expressions of the .NET flavor,&#160; got a bit of acclaim. It was one of the better days of my life, an encouragement that sometimes struggling alone in a South Dakota basement can lead to a little bit of notice. </p>  <p>One of the tricks that keeps me going back to nRegex is being able to generate code by using a regular expressions. Regular Expressions, though often reviled, turn out to be quite handy in a lot of situations. </p>  <p>Let’s say you have a table that looks like this:</p>  <pre class="brush:sql">	CREATE TABLE PackingList(<br />		PackingListId	INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, <br />		PackingItem		VARCHAR(50), <br />		Destination		VARCHAR(50)<br />	)<br />	GO</pre><br /><br /><p>&#160;</p><br /><br /><p>Let’s say you have a list of values:</p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:sql">Shoes<br />Camera<br />Laptop<br />Wallet</pre><br /><br /><p>The list is short for brevity but let&#8217;s say you want to insert them all into your table for a destination called //Build/. You know the syntax for an INSERT but it&#8217;s a bit of a nuisance to type over and over again. One thing you can do is to use a regular expression to match and then reference the results of your match in a replace. Over on nRegex, we&#8217;d paste in our list of items into the main text area and then use the regular expression (.+) to match each item, line by line. Because the items are matched into a group with your parenthesis, you can now write something like the following for your replace: </p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:sql">INSERT INTO PackingList VALUES('$1', '//Build/')</pre><br /><br /><p>And voila! You now just have to copy the results: </p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:sql">INSERT INTO PackingList VALUES('Shoes', '//Build/')<br />INSERT INTO PackingList VALUES('Camera', '//Build/')<br />INSERT INTO PackingList VALUES('Laptop', '//Build/')<br />INSERT INTO PackingList VALUES('Wallet', '//Build/')</pre><br /><img style="border-bottom: gray 1px solid; border-left: gray 1px solid; border-top: gray 1px solid; border-right: gray 1px solid" src="http://www.t3rse.com/meta_images/GeneratingCode1.jpg" /> <br /><br /><p>But that&#8217;s just a tip of the iceberg. There&#8217;s a lot more nifty regular expressions tricks for working with code. Here&#8217;s another one I run into quite often. Let&#8217;s say I have some code that looks like this:</p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:csharp">  rs[&quot;foo&quot;] = myFoo;<br />  rs[&quot;bar&quot;] = myBar;</pre><br /><br /><p>I want to swap what&#8217;s on either side of the equals sign to do the opposite type of assignment. Here&#8217;s my regular expression: </p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:pl">(.+)\s=\s(.+);</pre><br /><br /><p>And my replacement expression</p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:pl">$2 = $1;</pre><br /><br /><p>Et voila aussi! You can now copy the swapped values to wherever they need to go. </p><br /><img style="border-bottom: gray 1px solid; border-left: gray 1px solid; border-top: gray 1px solid; border-right: gray 1px solid" src="http://www.t3rse.com/meta_images/GeneratingCode2.jpg" /> <br /><br /><p>One final thing: any place that offers you regular expressions you can use these techniques. There are some subtle differences but as long as you have a conceptual understanding of what your goal is it&#8217;s quite easy to bend to the flavor of regular expressions presented. For example, if you are using Notepad++ and want to accomplish the same thing, you reference your groups with a leading backslash rather than the &quot;$&quot; character - in our first example you would use the following:</p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:sql">INSERT INTO PackingList VALUES('\1', '//Build/')</pre><br /><br /><p>This is, of course, just scratching the surface. It’s not that hard though! Once you learn the meaning of things like ^ or $ then you can manipulate strings in all sorts of ways that may have once not seemed possible. The best way to learn regular expressions hasn’t changed for many years. The two canonical books I always refer to are <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596528126/index.html">Mastering Regular Expressions</a> by <a href="http://regex.info/blog/">Jeffrey Friedl</a> and the <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596520694">Regular Expressions Cookbook</a> by Goyvaerts and Levithan. </p><br /><br /><table><tbody><br />    <tr><br />      <td><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596528126/index.html"><img src="http://www.t3rse.com/meta_images/Mastering Regular Expressions.gif" /></a></td><br /><br />      <td><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596520694"><img src="http://www.t3rse.com/meta_images/Regular Expressions Cookbook.gif" /></a></td><br />    </tr><br />  </tbody></table><br /><br /><p>&#160;</p><br /><br /><p>Although nRegex will allow you to hobble by I also recommend <a href="http://www.regexbuddy.com/">RegexBuddy</a>. <a href="http://www.rexv.org">Rexv</a> (which inspired nRegex) is a good tool though the Regular Expression engine is not .NET.</p><br /><br /><p>Last thing: do you have any nifty regex to code generation tricks you use on a regular basis? The audience of one you have in this space would love to learn them. </p><br /><br /><h2><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h2>  </div>
