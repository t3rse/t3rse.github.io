<h2><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h2>  <p>I’ve taken knocks in the past because of my penchant for closures and lambdas. Syntactically they never looked that strange to me and most of the time when I used them it was because it made more sense to get a sense of the flow of how things were assigned. I thought: this feels so natural, what makes it so different from some of the people I’m around using C#? Here’s an example of how I’d approach something: in the constructor, assign a loading handler, in that handler, assign a click handler, and rather than putting it in some separate method where I’d have to scroll or look elsewhere, just place it here: </p>  <pre class="brush:csharp">        public MainPage()<br />        {<br />            InitializeComponent();<br /><br />            this.Loaded += (o, e) =&gt; <br />            {<br />                myButton.Click += (_, e2) =&gt;<br />                {<br />                    myText.Text = &quot;Hello World&quot;;<br />                };<br />            };<br />        }</pre><br /><br /><p>But then the other day I was tinkering with KnockoutJS, writing some Javascript with jquery and it dawned on my why I approach things the way I do. </p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:js">        $(document).ready(function () {<br />            $('#myButton').click(function () {<br />                $('#myLabel').text('Hello World');<br />            });<br />        });</pre><br /><br /><p>It&#8217;s always interesting to make that connection more formally than trying to explain why my approach would be “better.” The advantage of being able to use a closure with the above approach has always been the main rational I’ve given when forced to come up with an answer. </p><br /><br /><h2><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h2>  </div>

<h2><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h2>  <p>The 5 second version of this, should you arrive via search, is that to get random rows, simply use an TOP query with&#160; <strong><em>ORDER BY NewId()</em></strong> expression. It’s really that simple! Take a look: </p>  <pre class="brush:sql">-- SAMPLE TABLE<br />CREATE TABLE Keywords(<br />	KeywordId INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY, <br />	KeywordValue VARCHAR(50)<br />)<br />GO<br /><br />-- SAMPLE DATA<br />DECLARE @N INT<br />SET @N = 1<br />WHILE @N &lt; 101 BEGIN<br />	INSERT INTO Keywords(KeywordValue)<br />		VALUES('key word ' + CONVERT(VARCHAR(5), @N))<br />	SET @N = @N + 1<br />END<br /><br />-- A TOP QUERY WITH ORDER BY NEWID()<br />SELECT TOP 5 * FROM Keywords ORDER BY NEWID()</pre><br /><br /><p>The longer version of this is that I recently was asked to generate random keywords for a website I was working on with a lookup table. Getting random numbers in TSQL is easy, the RAND() function does all the magic but getting rows is a lot more tricky, especially if you want to make sure you exclude anything you’ve previously retrieved. The above technique worked quite well and made it easy to allow for them to add and remove keywords on demand. </p><br /><br /><p>One interesting application of this is that you can combine it with RAND() to get random numbers via multiplier and random rows (RAND gets a random between 0 and 1 leaving you the responsibility to multiply it to control the range you want). </p><br /><br /><p>Here is where I thought this could be taken as a flexible way to get random numbers within a bounded range: </p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:sql">-- get a series of random numbers<br />SELECT TOP 5 Rand() * KeywordId FROM Keywords ORDER BY NEWID()</pre><br /><br /><p>There’s a lot of flexibility but SQL Server makes it trivial.&#160; </p><br /><br /><h2><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h2>  </div>

<h2><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h2>  <p>… a title which I hope brings massive attention to this blog and to this rant against those that are rabid in their attacks on Microsoft and the Silverlight platform. </p>  <p>First and foremost: Silverlight 5 has yet to be released. How can the platform be “dead” if we’re on the verge of a new version? </p>  <p>Secondly: Spend some time listening to <a href="http://wildermuth.com/2010/12/12/The_Next_Application_Platform_All_of_them">MVPs</a> and <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ShouldIUseHTML5OrSilverlightOneMansOpinion.aspx">Microsoft</a> <a href="http://jesseliberty.com/2011/05/16/yet-another-podcast-35silverlight-html5-and-developers/">people</a>. Even though there is this awkward gag order until <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">//Build/</a> it seems quite obvious that the platform will continue to be a viable option for developers.</p>  <p>Third: HTML5 is no panacea. Spend a few days looking into the different specifications and the <a href="http://findmebyip.com/#target-selector">varied support</a> by browsers and platforms. It will become obvious that the W3C is being true to their word when they say <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/02/htmlwg-pr.html">it won’t be “finished” for a while</a>.</p>  <p>Fourth: Grow Up. Yes you’ve made this enormous investment in Silverlight or WPF. I have too; the last 3 years of my life have been in the trenches and my employer took a calculated risk to do a significant amount of work in Silverlight. Does that mean that every rumor should shake you to the very foundation and cause emotional outbursts at being abandoned? Stay the course. When you have real information from Microsoft directly <strong>then</strong> you can have your break down if it’s not what you expected. I don’t consider my time wasted no matter what the case. I can take my knowledge of MVVM <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">elsewhere</a>. I know a lot more than I used to about asynchronous programming. </p>  <p>Fifth: Let’s just say it’s true. Does it still warrant all that drama? You’ll be fine. People are dying in wars, unrest, and natural disasters all over the place but guess what? If you’re a Silverlight Dev and They all of a sudden remove the Silverlight Project Template from your Visual Studio and run a secret binary on your local machine to destroy the plugin removing all evidence of its existence globally you’ll still be alive. You’ll still dust off your trousers and either port your work or begin new and fanciful things in a platform that you find available. </p>  <p>Sixth: Try to make a distinction between people who are vocal versus people who are actually building software. I’m aware of a project right now where I work that makes heavy use of COM. Yeah that “not dead but done” COM. People who build things usually have their heads down creating value. I know there are a lot of talking heads online, especially talkers unsympathetic to the “evil” b0rg in Redmond, but there’s a lot of noise for very little signal. It’s cool that people get passionate (I’m being passionate myself now too) but sometimes it’s a good thing to take a step back and survey the landscape of what is real and what is bluster.</p>  <p>I’ve already admitted I could be wrong. But as significant a decision Microsoft has potential to make, my approach is to take it in stride, try to learn as much as I can and be flexible since in the tech world, no matter who you are, change is inevitable. For some of us change, with all the concomitant turbulence, is fun.</p>  <h2><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h2>  </div>

<h3><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h3>  <p>I ran across <a href="http://framethink.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/how-facebook-ships-code/">this blog entry</a> which is an unofficial attempt by somoene to glean the internal workings of Facebook’s product and software development processes. There are some very interesting things to be noted, most of which I’ll just quote from the article directly: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>“resourcing for projects is purely voluntary”</p> </blockquote>  <p>It’s interesting from this unofficial post that project dynamics are organic and based on what engineers want to work on. It begs the question of how the more difficult and less pleasing problems are solved but I would hedge that by having people who are talented and motivated, difficult and more grimy problems might be what attract people that are always seeking challenges. Indeed, from later in the article: “<em>engineers generally want to work on infrastructure, scalability and “hard problems” — that’s where all the prestige is.</em>”.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>“Engineers handle entire feature themselves — front end javascript, backend database code, and everything in between.&#160; If they want help from a Designer (there are a limited staff of dedicated designers available), they need to get a Designer interested enough in their project to take it on.&#160; Same for Architect help.&#160; But in general, expectation is that engineers will handle everything they need themselves.”</p> </blockquote>  <p>This is one of the more fascinating points because it reflects one side of an approach to programming that I’ve encountered: that delivering some functionality is a process of ownership where a person generalizes across disciplines and technologies. The opposing viewpoint sees programming more in terms of division of labor with staff assigned to “tiers” of the technological back end: database developers, “business layer” or component programmers, user interface and so on. I always think of sports with this dichotomy where the former thinks of software development like basketball – a game that involves some specialization but really rewards the generalist who can play any role on a team, and football – a game of specialists where it’s a liability to do too many things since even the physique is developed on a per position basis. </p>  <p>Many people acknowledge generalists for small organization but it appears that Facebook, a company as large as they come, prefers them. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>“engineers responsible for testing, bug fixes, and post-launch maintenance of their own work.&#160; there are some unit-testing and integration-testing frameworks available, but only sporadically used.”</p> </blockquote>  <p>There are a few edits and comments to this point but the reason I find it interesting is that they are a corollary to the views that Joel Spolsky expressed on the StackOverflow podcast. Many developers, myself included, berate ourselves on a lack of unit testing with the assumption that “everyone is doing it, why can’t I?” As time passes, however, I realize that TDD and Unit Testing are very important but not essential. It’s a very unpopular opinion and while I admit that I strive to make my code testable and, especially on personal projects where I have enough control, architect my software so that it’s testable from the get-go. </p>  <h3><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h3>  </div>

Here is an example of my rewriting what could otherwise been a conditional if/else checking for factors of 3 and 5, but using a pattern match instead. </p>    <pre style="padding-bottom: 10px; line-height: 120%; margin: 1em 0px; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; font-family: courier; background: #000; color: #eee; font-size: 10pt; overflow: auto; padding-top: 10px">#light <br />let fizz num = <br />    match (num % 3 = 0) with <br />    | true -&gt; &quot;fizz&quot;<br />    | false -&gt; &quot;&quot;<br /><br />let buzz num = <br />    match (num % 5 = 0) with <br />    | true -&gt; &quot;buzz&quot;<br />    | false -&gt; &quot;&quot;<br /><br />let outform num fizCalc = <br />    match fizCalc.ToString().Length = 0 with<br />    | true -&gt; num.ToString()<br />    | false -&gt; fizCalc<br /><br />let rec printer nums =<br />    match nums with<br />    | [] -&gt; printfn &quot;-&quot;<br />    | h::t -&gt;         <br />        printfn &quot;%s&quot; (outform h ((fizz h) + (buzz h)))<br />        printer t<br /><br />let numbers = [1..100]<br />printer numbers</pre><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>Although I read claims that if/else conditional operations are more readable, I think the pattern match used consistently across scenarios above makes for something I find quite readable.</p><br /><br /><h3><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h3>  </div>
