  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>   <p>“Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.”&#160; - Samuel Beckett</p> </blockquote>  <p>I’ve had a blog of some sort for more than a decade. I started on <a href="http://radio-weblogs.com/0110187/">Userland</a>. I’ve been through most blogging platforms in the .NET space. At some point I started to want to do things my own way, to customize the look, feel, and process of blogging. It culminated in my own attempt at a blog engine. </p>  <p>I learned the hard way that half-hearted attempts at blog engines are not only a <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2012/08/09/why-wordpress/">road to failure</a>, they also mean that every time I had the thought of making a post I’d run into some quirk of my software and be distracted enough to lose the motivation to post. But I never quite got into solving the blogging platform problems because I had other, more interesting projects I wanted to work on. </p>  <p>Hence failure. </p>  <p>But as the world changes around me, as blogs get gobbled up by tweets and tweets get gobbled up by shares, I miss the slower way of doing things. I miss the long blog posts that mean more than a five second scan or a referral link to click. </p>  <p>I’m not only missing out as a consumer, I’m missing out as a producer. I’ve been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Up-Your-Mind-Smarter/dp/185788275X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349305146&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=power+up+your+mind">Power Up Your Mind</a> and one thing that stuck with me is that teaching another person is a great way to really learn something. On one of my old blogs, <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com">Metadeveloper</a>, I spent a lot of time writing at length in technical terms. Not only did my long posts help me understand the things I was explaining in more detail, but over and over I’d find myself searching my own blog for a solved problem I’d documented. </p>  <p>So here is where I try again. No more tinkering with my own blogging software, on this attempt I will use BlogEngine.net and apart from styling and theming, I will keep my tweaks to a minimum. Instead of trying to partition my posts for nontechnical friends and fellow programmers, this is just going to be whatever is on my mind, whatever I’m exploring, or wherever I’m finding some inspiration. </p>  <p>Although I’m not planning on it I will probably fail again. Sometimes life accelerates and it seems like I’ve blinked an eye as a few months have passed. There are times when more important things take center stage. When my son was born my blog and online activity went dark because I was caught between helping my wife and caring for the young one. I don’t regret those moments but I would regret not trying again, and not failing better. </p>

<h2><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h2>  <p>It may be easy to miss amidst all the hoopla around Windows 8 but the Norwegian Developers Conference just released all their session vidoes on the site. </p>  <p>It’s been a while since I’ve gotten to go to a conference but the last few I have attended were put on by Microsoft. Although this has advantages in the sense that it coalesces the “experts” of specific Microsoft technologies, many of the presenters work at Microsoft and therefore don’t have a similar problem set that you or I might slogging our way through building products, often with older (read: more “boring”) software. There are also some talks on development techniques like <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/">BDD</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">DDD</a> that are not product specific.</p>  <p>The good thing about NDC is that it seems a lot of the presenters come from an outside perspective so it’s a good balance for a lot of the MIX / PDC type stuff I’ve been watching of late. Without further ado:</p>  <p>Direct Download from NDC website: <a href="http://ndc2011.no/agenda.aspx?cat=1071&amp;id=-1&amp;day=3726">Day 1</a> | <a href="http://ndc2011.no/agenda.aspx?cat=1071&amp;id=-1&amp;day=3727">Day 2</a> | <a href="http://ndc2011.no/agenda.aspx?cat=1071&amp;id=-1&amp;day=3728">Day 3</a></p>  <p><a href="http://goo.gl/IKrBh">Roy Osherove’s “unofficial” torrent</a></p>  <h2><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h2>  </div>

<h2><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h2>  <p>Many moons ago I got about <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmans2007UltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolListForWindows.aspx">0.25 seconds of fame</a> when <a href="http://www.nregex.com">nRegex</a>, a tool I wrote for evaluating regular expressions of the .NET flavor,&#160; got a bit of acclaim. It was one of the better days of my life, an encouragement that sometimes struggling alone in a South Dakota basement can lead to a little bit of notice. </p>  <p>One of the tricks that keeps me going back to nRegex is being able to generate code by using a regular expressions. Regular Expressions, though often reviled, turn out to be quite handy in a lot of situations. </p>  <p>Let’s say you have a table that looks like this:</p>  <pre class="brush:sql">	CREATE TABLE PackingList(<br />		PackingListId	INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, <br />		PackingItem		VARCHAR(50), <br />		Destination		VARCHAR(50)<br />	)<br />	GO</pre><br /><br /><p>&#160;</p><br /><br /><p>Let’s say you have a list of values:</p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:sql">Shoes<br />Camera<br />Laptop<br />Wallet</pre><br /><br /><p>The list is short for brevity but let&#8217;s say you want to insert them all into your table for a destination called //Build/. You know the syntax for an INSERT but it&#8217;s a bit of a nuisance to type over and over again. One thing you can do is to use a regular expression to match and then reference the results of your match in a replace. Over on nRegex, we&#8217;d paste in our list of items into the main text area and then use the regular expression (.+) to match each item, line by line. Because the items are matched into a group with your parenthesis, you can now write something like the following for your replace: </p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:sql">INSERT INTO PackingList VALUES('$1', '//Build/')</pre><br /><br /><p>And voila! You now just have to copy the results: </p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:sql">INSERT INTO PackingList VALUES('Shoes', '//Build/')<br />INSERT INTO PackingList VALUES('Camera', '//Build/')<br />INSERT INTO PackingList VALUES('Laptop', '//Build/')<br />INSERT INTO PackingList VALUES('Wallet', '//Build/')</pre><br /><img style="border-bottom: gray 1px solid; border-left: gray 1px solid; border-top: gray 1px solid; border-right: gray 1px solid" src="http://www.t3rse.com/meta_images/GeneratingCode1.jpg" /> <br /><br /><p>But that&#8217;s just a tip of the iceberg. There&#8217;s a lot more nifty regular expressions tricks for working with code. Here&#8217;s another one I run into quite often. Let&#8217;s say I have some code that looks like this:</p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:csharp">  rs[&quot;foo&quot;] = myFoo;<br />  rs[&quot;bar&quot;] = myBar;</pre><br /><br /><p>I want to swap what&#8217;s on either side of the equals sign to do the opposite type of assignment. Here&#8217;s my regular expression: </p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:pl">(.+)\s=\s(.+);</pre><br /><br /><p>And my replacement expression</p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:pl">$2 = $1;</pre><br /><br /><p>Et voila aussi! You can now copy the swapped values to wherever they need to go. </p><br /><img style="border-bottom: gray 1px solid; border-left: gray 1px solid; border-top: gray 1px solid; border-right: gray 1px solid" src="http://www.t3rse.com/meta_images/GeneratingCode2.jpg" /> <br /><br /><p>One final thing: any place that offers you regular expressions you can use these techniques. There are some subtle differences but as long as you have a conceptual understanding of what your goal is it&#8217;s quite easy to bend to the flavor of regular expressions presented. For example, if you are using Notepad++ and want to accomplish the same thing, you reference your groups with a leading backslash rather than the &quot;$&quot; character - in our first example you would use the following:</p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:sql">INSERT INTO PackingList VALUES('\1', '//Build/')</pre><br /><br /><p>This is, of course, just scratching the surface. It’s not that hard though! Once you learn the meaning of things like ^ or $ then you can manipulate strings in all sorts of ways that may have once not seemed possible. The best way to learn regular expressions hasn’t changed for many years. The two canonical books I always refer to are <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596528126/index.html">Mastering Regular Expressions</a> by <a href="http://regex.info/blog/">Jeffrey Friedl</a> and the <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596520694">Regular Expressions Cookbook</a> by Goyvaerts and Levithan. </p><br /><br /><table><tbody><br />    <tr><br />      <td><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596528126/index.html"><img src="http://www.t3rse.com/meta_images/Mastering Regular Expressions.gif" /></a></td><br /><br />      <td><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596520694"><img src="http://www.t3rse.com/meta_images/Regular Expressions Cookbook.gif" /></a></td><br />    </tr><br />  </tbody></table><br /><br /><p>&#160;</p><br /><br /><p>Although nRegex will allow you to hobble by I also recommend <a href="http://www.regexbuddy.com/">RegexBuddy</a>. <a href="http://www.rexv.org">Rexv</a> (which inspired nRegex) is a good tool though the Regular Expression engine is not .NET.</p><br /><br /><p>Last thing: do you have any nifty regex to code generation tricks you use on a regular basis? The audience of one you have in this space would love to learn them. </p><br /><br /><h2><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h2>  </div>

<h2><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h2>  <p>I’ve taken knocks in the past because of my penchant for closures and lambdas. Syntactically they never looked that strange to me and most of the time when I used them it was because it made more sense to get a sense of the flow of how things were assigned. I thought: this feels so natural, what makes it so different from some of the people I’m around using C#? Here’s an example of how I’d approach something: in the constructor, assign a loading handler, in that handler, assign a click handler, and rather than putting it in some separate method where I’d have to scroll or look elsewhere, just place it here: </p>  <pre class="brush:csharp">        public MainPage()<br />        {<br />            InitializeComponent();<br /><br />            this.Loaded += (o, e) =&gt; <br />            {<br />                myButton.Click += (_, e2) =&gt;<br />                {<br />                    myText.Text = &quot;Hello World&quot;;<br />                };<br />            };<br />        }</pre><br /><br /><p>But then the other day I was tinkering with KnockoutJS, writing some Javascript with jquery and it dawned on my why I approach things the way I do. </p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:js">        $(document).ready(function () {<br />            $('#myButton').click(function () {<br />                $('#myLabel').text('Hello World');<br />            });<br />        });</pre><br /><br /><p>It&#8217;s always interesting to make that connection more formally than trying to explain why my approach would be “better.” The advantage of being able to use a closure with the above approach has always been the main rational I’ve given when forced to come up with an answer. </p><br /><br /><h2><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h2>  </div>

<h2><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h2>  <p>The 5 second version of this, should you arrive via search, is that to get random rows, simply use an TOP query with&#160; <strong><em>ORDER BY NewId()</em></strong> expression. It’s really that simple! Take a look: </p>  <pre class="brush:sql">-- SAMPLE TABLE<br />CREATE TABLE Keywords(<br />	KeywordId INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY, <br />	KeywordValue VARCHAR(50)<br />)<br />GO<br /><br />-- SAMPLE DATA<br />DECLARE @N INT<br />SET @N = 1<br />WHILE @N &lt; 101 BEGIN<br />	INSERT INTO Keywords(KeywordValue)<br />		VALUES('key word ' + CONVERT(VARCHAR(5), @N))<br />	SET @N = @N + 1<br />END<br /><br />-- A TOP QUERY WITH ORDER BY NEWID()<br />SELECT TOP 5 * FROM Keywords ORDER BY NEWID()</pre><br /><br /><p>The longer version of this is that I recently was asked to generate random keywords for a website I was working on with a lookup table. Getting random numbers in TSQL is easy, the RAND() function does all the magic but getting rows is a lot more tricky, especially if you want to make sure you exclude anything you’ve previously retrieved. The above technique worked quite well and made it easy to allow for them to add and remove keywords on demand. </p><br /><br /><p>One interesting application of this is that you can combine it with RAND() to get random numbers via multiplier and random rows (RAND gets a random between 0 and 1 leaving you the responsibility to multiply it to control the range you want). </p><br /><br /><p>Here is where I thought this could be taken as a flexible way to get random numbers within a bounded range: </p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:sql">-- get a series of random numbers<br />SELECT TOP 5 Rand() * KeywordId FROM Keywords ORDER BY NEWID()</pre><br /><br /><p>There’s a lot of flexibility but SQL Server makes it trivial.&#160; </p><br /><br /><h2><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h2>  </div>

<h2><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h2>  <p>… a title which I hope brings massive attention to this blog and to this rant against those that are rabid in their attacks on Microsoft and the Silverlight platform. </p>  <p>First and foremost: Silverlight 5 has yet to be released. How can the platform be “dead” if we’re on the verge of a new version? </p>  <p>Secondly: Spend some time listening to <a href="http://wildermuth.com/2010/12/12/The_Next_Application_Platform_All_of_them">MVPs</a> and <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ShouldIUseHTML5OrSilverlightOneMansOpinion.aspx">Microsoft</a> <a href="http://jesseliberty.com/2011/05/16/yet-another-podcast-35silverlight-html5-and-developers/">people</a>. Even though there is this awkward gag order until <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">//Build/</a> it seems quite obvious that the platform will continue to be a viable option for developers.</p>  <p>Third: HTML5 is no panacea. Spend a few days looking into the different specifications and the <a href="http://findmebyip.com/#target-selector">varied support</a> by browsers and platforms. It will become obvious that the W3C is being true to their word when they say <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/02/htmlwg-pr.html">it won’t be “finished” for a while</a>.</p>  <p>Fourth: Grow Up. Yes you’ve made this enormous investment in Silverlight or WPF. I have too; the last 3 years of my life have been in the trenches and my employer took a calculated risk to do a significant amount of work in Silverlight. Does that mean that every rumor should shake you to the very foundation and cause emotional outbursts at being abandoned? Stay the course. When you have real information from Microsoft directly <strong>then</strong> you can have your break down if it’s not what you expected. I don’t consider my time wasted no matter what the case. I can take my knowledge of MVVM <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">elsewhere</a>. I know a lot more than I used to about asynchronous programming. </p>  <p>Fifth: Let’s just say it’s true. Does it still warrant all that drama? You’ll be fine. People are dying in wars, unrest, and natural disasters all over the place but guess what? If you’re a Silverlight Dev and They all of a sudden remove the Silverlight Project Template from your Visual Studio and run a secret binary on your local machine to destroy the plugin removing all evidence of its existence globally you’ll still be alive. You’ll still dust off your trousers and either port your work or begin new and fanciful things in a platform that you find available. </p>  <p>Sixth: Try to make a distinction between people who are vocal versus people who are actually building software. I’m aware of a project right now where I work that makes heavy use of COM. Yeah that “not dead but done” COM. People who build things usually have their heads down creating value. I know there are a lot of talking heads online, especially talkers unsympathetic to the “evil” b0rg in Redmond, but there’s a lot of noise for very little signal. It’s cool that people get passionate (I’m being passionate myself now too) but sometimes it’s a good thing to take a step back and survey the landscape of what is real and what is bluster.</p>  <p>I’ve already admitted I could be wrong. But as significant a decision Microsoft has potential to make, my approach is to take it in stride, try to learn as much as I can and be flexible since in the tech world, no matter who you are, change is inevitable. For some of us change, with all the concomitant turbulence, is fun.</p>  <h2><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h2>  </div>

<h3><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h3>  <p>I ran across <a href="http://framethink.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/how-facebook-ships-code/">this blog entry</a> which is an unofficial attempt by somoene to glean the internal workings of Facebook’s product and software development processes. There are some very interesting things to be noted, most of which I’ll just quote from the article directly: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>“resourcing for projects is purely voluntary”</p> </blockquote>  <p>It’s interesting from this unofficial post that project dynamics are organic and based on what engineers want to work on. It begs the question of how the more difficult and less pleasing problems are solved but I would hedge that by having people who are talented and motivated, difficult and more grimy problems might be what attract people that are always seeking challenges. Indeed, from later in the article: “<em>engineers generally want to work on infrastructure, scalability and “hard problems” — that’s where all the prestige is.</em>”.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>“Engineers handle entire feature themselves — front end javascript, backend database code, and everything in between.&#160; If they want help from a Designer (there are a limited staff of dedicated designers available), they need to get a Designer interested enough in their project to take it on.&#160; Same for Architect help.&#160; But in general, expectation is that engineers will handle everything they need themselves.”</p> </blockquote>  <p>This is one of the more fascinating points because it reflects one side of an approach to programming that I’ve encountered: that delivering some functionality is a process of ownership where a person generalizes across disciplines and technologies. The opposing viewpoint sees programming more in terms of division of labor with staff assigned to “tiers” of the technological back end: database developers, “business layer” or component programmers, user interface and so on. I always think of sports with this dichotomy where the former thinks of software development like basketball – a game that involves some specialization but really rewards the generalist who can play any role on a team, and football – a game of specialists where it’s a liability to do too many things since even the physique is developed on a per position basis. </p>  <p>Many people acknowledge generalists for small organization but it appears that Facebook, a company as large as they come, prefers them. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>“engineers responsible for testing, bug fixes, and post-launch maintenance of their own work.&#160; there are some unit-testing and integration-testing frameworks available, but only sporadically used.”</p> </blockquote>  <p>There are a few edits and comments to this point but the reason I find it interesting is that they are a corollary to the views that Joel Spolsky expressed on the StackOverflow podcast. Many developers, myself included, berate ourselves on a lack of unit testing with the assumption that “everyone is doing it, why can’t I?” As time passes, however, I realize that TDD and Unit Testing are very important but not essential. It’s a very unpopular opinion and while I admit that I strive to make my code testable and, especially on personal projects where I have enough control, architect my software so that it’s testable from the get-go. </p>  <h3><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h3>  </div>
