  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first developer conference I ever attended was VBITS 98 in San Francisco. I won&rsquo;t forget that experience or the keynote from <a href="https://twitter.com/psaffo">Paul Saffo</a>, a futurist who exhorted us to look beyond our technological present and to try to anticipate and respond to trends.</p>

<p>It was completely my own efforts but something must have stuck: learning about vtable binding and COM was useful but I also realized that I needed to do everything I could to get involved with web development. Soon after I was doing a lot more with Visual Interdev than I was with Visual Basic &ndash; and the rest is history.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kpcb.com/partner/mary-meeker">Mary Meeker</a> recently released her 2014 Internet Trends Report and it&rsquo;s an opportunity, these many years down the road, to try to see the big picture and get a bigger sense of direction. I looked at a few versions: <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends">the primary source</a> and a helpful <a href="http://techcrunch.com/gallery/mary-meeker-internet-trends/">annotated version</a> on TechCrunch.</p>

<p>Here are my takeaways: (apologies for going <a href="http://paulgraham.com/nthings.html">List of N</a>)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Mobile is the place to be as a developer.</p>

<p> I&rsquo;m fortunate to be a full time Android dev at present and it will be important to hone and improve the skill set. Apple&rsquo;s recent announcement of Swift is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of iOS development as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Personal Education</p>

<p> In the midst of declining quality of education, online education is at a groundswell for those who are willing to take initiative. Taking initiative is easy for me (I love learning) but I&rsquo;m easily distracted so focusing on a single topic or subject matter area is more of a challenge. Coursera has recently launched educational tracks (Android, Data Science) which will help with this.</p></li>
<li><p>Single Purpose Apps / Invisible Apps</p>

<p> Apps should be designed to do one thing. Invisible apps leverage notification, context, and predictive computation to give you information when you need it. Here is the quote lifted from slide 41:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We’re entering the age of apps as service layers.
  These are apps you have on your phone but only open
  when you know they explicitly have something to say to you.
  They aren’t for ‘idle browsing,’ they’re purpose-built &amp;
  informed by contextual signals like hardware sensors,
  location, history of use &amp; predictive computation.&rdquo;
  – Matthew Panzarino, TechCrunch, 5/15/14</p></blockquote>

<p> My mindset to date is on apps that users interact with but I need to start thinking more of apps as a way of passively doing things for the user &ndash; as <a href="http://www.deepelement.com/articles">my colleague</a> at Vertigo put it: &ldquo;giving [users] an additional sense.&rdquo; Sometimes this can be a simple matter of phrasing; several times now <a href="http://forecast.io">forecast.io</a> will tell me it will be raining &ldquo;in a few minutes&rdquo; with incredible accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Design as a feature</p>

<p> Rethinking old concepts (e.g. Yellow pages) in mobile design. I was impressed by the WWDC 2014 keynote in which Apple demonstrated for those of us who have forgotten that for them, design is a feature. I saw people joking during the keynote about all the references to transparency in UI of the new version of OSX, Yosemite, but in my mind spending as much time in the keynote on the topic just shows how important it is on their part for things to look and behave correctly.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>There is a lot more in the report: the growth of advertising, the flow of information through social networks, apps as second screens, China (the big project there for my son to learn Chinese?), among others. Definitely worth a few minutes of reading and some time reflecting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I visited New York for the first time when I was still based in a Southern California exurb. It was overwhelming, beginning with the clear memory of a man yelling at me to get out of his way upon exiting an elevator. I&rsquo;d been to many cities but New York is a singular experience: dense, difficult, and beautiful.</p>

<p>When I got a new Mac earlier this year, my first reaction was to its beauty. After years on stodgy looking PCs, the contours and heft of the hardware were a revelation. I think of it with the same sensibility as I do New York the city &ndash; a place I visited, a place that was cool and surprised you continuously.</p>

<p>The exurbs I&rsquo;d gotten used to are comfortable places. You must have a car to get around but it&rsquo;s easy to find places you like to eat and hang out. The people are relaxed. You can still get to the proper &ldquo;city&rdquo; but only after working up the motivation to deal with traffic and drive for 30 minutes. I did it all the time but relegated it to night time, when working hours were over.</p>

<p>I think about my PC in terms of those exurbs. The comfort and familiarity of oft wandered environs, an intuition for where things are and how they can be managed. I can still get to &ldquo;the city&rdquo; &ndash; install powershell, cygwin, other components to have feature/tool parity and yet these are always visits; my real home is in explorer and other executables I run in the gui. Like MarkdownPad, where I am typing this entry.</p>

<p>Oddly enough though, now the Mac is where I get my work done. I commute from comfort and familiarity to a polished, glittering environment that is seductive and yet requires regular interaction with a terminal, vi, and unix utilities of yore. When it all works I feel like one of the cosmopolitans I saw navigating the streets and public transit with power and ease. When I hit a road block I go back into bumpkin mode sensing that if so many people can do it I should be able to figure it out and yet yearning for a the kind of protective abstractions built into suburbs: cars that separate you from the street; chain stores where service is standardized; Faustian bargains with cheap fast food.</p>

<p>And yet time is having its effect. No one becomes a part of the city overnight but the difference between a small country town and a booming metropolis is that an outsider can live in the former for decades and never really become the embodiment of the place while cities absorb people whole, blurring origins until they are a part of the throng and cannot remember when they arrived.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although I switched to Octopress via inspiration from <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2014/04/migrating-blogspot-to-octopress-part-1-introduction/">Staxmanade&rsquo;s blog series</a> on exporting content from Blogger, my current blogging has been with BlogEngine.net. Here is how I migrated the content over.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Export to BlogML</strong></strong></p>

<p>The first task was to export my current blog entries. You can generate a BlogML file with all of your posts with the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Log into the administration portal then choose Settings.</li>
<li>On the subnavigation select the &ldquo;Import &amp; Export&rdquo; option.</li>
<li>Click the <em>Export</em> button.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong><strong>Importing to Octopress</strong></strong></p>

<p>You need to generate files for each of your posts. I found <a href="https://github.com/philippkueng/philippkueng.github.com/blob/30ef1570f06d33938b18d5eee7767d6641b9a779/source/_import/blogml.rb">a lengthy Ruby script</a> to do this but I just hacked up what I needed in a few lines of powershell:</p>

<pre><code>$file_name = "{0}-{1}.html"
$post_template = 
@"
---
layout: post
title: `"{0}`"
comments: true
---

{1}
"@
$xml = [xml](get-content BlogML.xml)
$xml.blog.posts.post | % { 
  $name = $file_name -f [DateTime]::Parse($_."date-created").ToString("yyyy-MM-dd"), ($_."post-url" -replace ".aspx", "")
  $name = $name -replace "/post/\d{4}/\d{2}/\d{2}/", ""
  $value = $post_template -f $_.title.InnerText, $_.content.InnerText

  New-Item -Path . -Name $name -Value $value -ItemType file
}
</code></pre>

<p>I ran it in the same directory as my BlogML.xml file and it iterates over each post generating a file and using the post name and created date for a unique file name.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Fixing Images and Links</strong></strong></p>

<p>You may need to clean up links to images and other posts. I&rsquo;ve done it for images and something similar could be done for posts (I don&rsquo;t link to myself very often though I may update this script when there is time). First, I copied all my images out of the /App_Data/files directory and into /public/images in my octopress folder structure. Next, here is an powershell one liner (where my BlogEngine was &ldquo;<a href="http://www.t3rse.com">http://www.t3rse.com</a>&rdquo; you will need to make sure you replace with whatever domain name you were using):</p>

<pre><code>ls *.html -rec | %{ $f=$_; (gc $f.PSPath) | %{ $_ -replace "http://www.t3rse.com/image.axd\?picture=", "/images/" } | sc $f.PSPath }
</code></pre>

<p>This script, run in the same directory as the generated posts visits each (the .html extension) and does simple replace.</p>

<hr />

<p>There may be some additional details migrating (for example, I ignored comments, I also didn&rsquo;t pull in the categories for each post) that I add tweaks for in the future. If you have a bright idea comment or modify my gists on github &ndash; I&rsquo;d love to improve them for anyone else to use.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been through a lot of blogging engines. My first blog was built on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_UserLand">Radio Userland</a> platform, created by Dave Winer who technorati know as the guy (controversially) behind RSS. I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://dasblog.codeplex.com/">Das Blog</a>, <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/">Blogger</a>, and  <a href="http://www.t3rse.com">BlogEngine.net</a>. I&rsquo;ve used <a href="http://da5id.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>. I&rsquo;ve even implemented my own lightweight blogging platform in the past. It&rsquo;s interesting how the concept of blogging is so simple but the platforms and tools are anything but. Perhaps it has to do with what I will call the &ldquo;Todo List Software Principle&rdquo; &ndash; the more generalized a problem set, the more variety and churn will exist for technical solutions.</p>

<p>Each platform I&rsquo;ve used had things I liked: Userland dealt with hosting and server configuration while I simply wrote, Das Blog was written with a toolset I understand well, Blogger was painless like Userland but also free, writing my own blog engine helped me understand why it was so difficult and BlogEngine was more modern and sleek than Das Blog.</p>

<p>Each platform also had pain points: Userland wasn&rsquo;t free and ultimately my content was not my own. Das Blog had pain points when new versions of the .NET framework started to come around. Blogger was free but complex if you needed to engage the templates and underlying structure of the engine. BlogEngine&rsquo;s ecosystem seems to have died and comments are a nightmare.</p>

<p>My colleague <a href="http://staxmanade.com/" title="Staxmanade">Staxmanade</a> introduced me to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> as he was in the process of migrating old posts from blogger and writing <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2014/04/migrating-blogspot-to-octopress-part-1-introduction/">a series of posts about it</a>. Octopress is an experiment but here is what I like: it strips away a lot of the abstractions from my previous blog engines and allows me to deal with, for the most part, plain text. It also integrates with Github where my content can be hosted for free. Finally it&rsquo;s a programmer&rsquo;s blog engine; the idea of using markdown and code to build my blog is appealing.</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m certain <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> is not the last blog engine I try my hand at (foreshadowing here) I will be using it in the forthcoming weeks both to follow <a href="http://staxmanade.com/2014/04/migrating-blogspot-to-octopress-part-1-introduction/">the Staxmanade series</a> and to learn more about Ruby and statically generated websites.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p style="line-height: 160%">There’s always a big rush when someone you’ve respected and admired for a long time writes a specific response to your question. I’ve still got an email from 2004 when the author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Egan">Greg Egan</a> took a moment to reply to an email I sent him. </p>  <p style="line-height: 160%">Ritholtz, for the small number of friends and my parents who take time to read this blog, is a well known in the world of finance, whose blog <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/">The Big Picture</a> I’ve followed for many years now. You can read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Ritholtz">his Wikipedia entry</a> for more specifics but it suffices to say that offering a direct response to a kid from Nairobi wouldn’t need to be a high priority. But he did and I think quite a few people whose world intersects with mine but not that of the Bloomberg/Investor will benefit from what he sent my way. </p>  <p style="line-height: 160%">First, here is <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2014/02/which-investment-behaviors-really-matter-for-individual-investors/#comment-696927">what I wrote in a comment on his blog</a>, asking about what individual investors should do if we’re so demonstrably bad in our decision making: </p>  <blockquote>   <p style="line-height: 200%">So a question then for “Guest Author,” Barry, or any others from the world of the much spited individual investor.</p>    <p style="line-height: 160%">What’s a little guy like me supposed to do given that:</p>    <p style="line-height: 200%">1.

  <div class="entry-content"><p style="line-height: 160%">I had a conversation over the holidays with a person who rejected the idea of fiction or writing about things that “didn’t exist.” Although the origin of the discussion was superheroes I thought a good bridge for said person might be Iron Man since his brand of hero more closely resembles Science Fiction than mythology[1]. Unfortunately Science Fiction fell under the umbrella of “things that don’t exist” and was therefore a subject to be ignored. Moments like this are a bit jarring for me; when I have a very basic assumption (Science Fiction is valuable) that is challenged at its root and I have to mentally reconstruct the rationale for so deep seeded a belief that I’ve come to assume is common for most people. </p>  <p style="line-height: 160%">What is fundamental about Science Fiction is that one must imagine things that may not exist within the context of human nature and narrative, things which are constant. Love is a human nature, as much in the time of the written letter as it is in the previously nonexistent age of email. Formative education is a part of all of our lives, whether it is the tragic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman">bildungsroman</a> of an impoverished boy in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140435387/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0140435387&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=t3rse-20">Jude the Obscure</a> or the near future when <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/the-boy-genius-of-ulan-bator.html">children in impoverished countries learn from MOOCs</a>. </p>  <p style="line-height: 160%">While I would be hard pressed to find any advantage in deliberately trying not to imagine things that don’t exist, a person’s profession does bear heavily on how much of useful such a skill might be perceived. Although they are few and far between, some fields have no bearing on the understanding of technology and people. But for any engineer, and even more so for the software engineer, the entire basis of one’s work is to build things that do not exist. They are wrought from imagination, even the most pedestrian software that must be built. </p>  <p style="line-height: 160%">What catapults an engineer from mere laborer to innovator is the ability to conceive an imagined object of the future in the present. An example of this that I recently read about is the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Albert_Link">Edwin Link</a>, the inventor of a flight simulator called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_Trainer">Link Trainer</a> in the 1920s. It’s hard to imagine in the present but fatality rates for prospective pilots in that age were shocking. Link had an engineer’s mind and came up with the concept of a simulator (he built them from parts used by his family’s organ manufacturing company) that would allow a learner to practice on the ground, in a safe environment before taking to the air. It seems so obvious when we look in hindsight but Link had to work hard for many years to gain acceptance that his contraption would be of any use. He persevered because he could conceive of a device of the future in the present and how it would be valuable. </p>  <p style="line-height: 160%">In the world of software, where the constraints of traditional engineering are loosened[2], the ability to think in a future against typical convention wields tremendous power. There are many precedents for this from the innovations in places like the famed Augmentation Research Center at Stanford Research Institute[3] to more recent evolutions of source control management[4]. In each case the engineer must stretch his or her imagination into the future and pull us into it from the present. </p>  <p style="line-height: 160%">Writers of Science Fiction are aware of this implication in their work. Not too long ago Neal Stephenson <a href="http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/fall2011/innovation-starvation">made the case</a> for Science Fiction writers to be deliberate in their power to inspire; put colloquially on <a href="http://io9.com/5846707/science-fiction-writers-have-a-job-and-its-time-to-do-it-says-neal-stephenson">io9.com</a>: </p>  <blockquote>   <p style="line-height: 160%">“<strong>SF needs to stop mucking around with steampunk and dystopia, and start making decent roadmaps for a future where we all want to live</strong>.”</p> </blockquote>  <p style="line-height: 160%">All of this to say that it is possible to live in a world where there is no thought of the future, in a continuous reaction to what the world presents to us. It is possible to ignore science, the human narrative, and the future things which don’t exist. When I think of this possibility, I think of a very dark and drab place. But this is not a world for an engineer, especially not a software engineer. We have to build things which don’t exist. And the difference between the engineer who is perfectly contented to rehash a precedent and an Elon Musk, our present day Tony Stark[5], is that Musk is immersed in <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-wants-to-build-hyperloop-model-2013-11">hyperloops</a>, <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">mass produced electric vehicles</a>, <a href="http://www.spacex.com/">space infrastructure</a>, and <a href="http://www.solarcity.com/">commoditized solar energy</a>; a future world that is being made to exist.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>[1] I personally believe that myth is important as well; the definition of “<em>ideology in narrative form</em>” implies that in understanding myth, one can understand how a person thinks. In the case of super heroes, whether they are Greek titans like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus">Prometheus</a> or as American as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_america">Steve Rogers</a>, they tell us about our deeper values.</p>  <p>[2] An in depth exploration is Jack Reeves excellent essay “<a href="http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design.html">What is Software Design?</a>”</p>  <p>[3] Case in point: the “<a href="http://sloan.stanford.edu/mousesite/1968Demo.html">mother of all demos</a>” done by Douglas Engelbart in 1968.</p>  <p>[4] As a person who went from centralized source control (SVN) to distributed (GIT) and back, the latter has hacked my brain with concepts I didn’t “get” before I experienced them. Now it’s hard going back.</p>  <p>[5] <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYrxSQ_Y2Iw">Tony Stark is Iron Man</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just completed <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/startup">Startup Engineering</a>, a Stanford <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOOC">MOOC</a> offered through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>. There are two broad themes in the course: one that is technical and another that is philosophical. </p>  <p><strong>Technical</strong></p>  <p>Although the course assumes limited technical knowledge, it would be difficult for a person without at least moderate technical skills to complete this portion with any depth of understanding. A brief summary of topics covered demonstrates this: </p>  <p>Ubuntu Linux   <br />AWS    <br />Heroku     <br />Bash     <br />Emacs     <br />Git     <br />Github    <br />Javascript     <br />Coffeescript     <br />Node.js     <br />Express     <br />Sequelize     <br />PostgreSQL     <br />JSON    <br />Chrome    <br />Bootstrap     <br />Mobile&#160; <br />HTML5</p>  <p>Any one of those topics could be a lengthy course on its own and, even though the course is designed more for exposure, the depth of the subject matter can be overwhelming. But for those who persevered the reward was a strong foundation along with reference materials (discussed later under Reference Material) to revisit.</p>  <p><strong>Philosophical</strong></p>  <p>Beyond technical knowledge the course offers practical direction on how to think about and execute startup concepts. Two things make this work exceptionally well: first, the depth provided in written lectures (discussed later under Reference Material), and second the instructor, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/balajis">Balaji Srinivasan</a> whose track record and experiences provide the gravitas that separates this course material from the type of people who post inspirational startup drivel with hopes of getting posted to Hacker News. </p>  <p>Perhaps the most fascinating thing about the philosophy arc of the course comes from its origin: it was initially offered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_thiel">Peter Thiel</a> as CS183 at Stanford. Thiel is well known as an avowed libertarian, and Srinivasan, beyond describing the course as a “spiritual sequel” to its initial offering, continues along these themes providing credible evidence in support of this political and economic philosophy. One lecture in particular, concerning regulation, makes a devastating case against how interventions impede innovation and business[1]. </p>  <p><strong>Reference Material</strong></p>  <p>Most MOOC offerings involve video lectures with some sparse reference materials. The videos are well produced and it’s easy to watch, pause, and rewind. Startup Engineering was vastly different: all of the lectures were written in long form and although there were videos Srinivasan essentially skims through the written material. Some people wanted more screen time for the instructor but this was one of the best aspects of the course for me; I ended up with a book of lecture material on my tablet to consume at the speed of my designation. The lectures are dense: I just counted 130 external links/references in the first provided lecture alone. The lectures that involve tasks performed on AWS were straightforward and methodical. I cannot emphasize enough how valuable these were and I will probably use them to start some of the more technical tasks again from scratch to uncover what I might have missed. One last thing that deserves mention are the guest lectures delivered by founders of some more well known startups. It was the proverbial icing on the cake. </p>  <p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>  <p>I would recommend Startup Engineering to anyone interested in either starting a technology company or to those who simply want a broad overview of the technologies and engineering of web applications. Although the course is officially past its timeframe it’s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/startup">still available for sign up</a> as I’m writing this blog entry. I would recommend waiting for the next offering and participating in the competition among students for crowd sourcing a business idea. </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>[1] I’m not “libertarian” myself although I do think all of the ideas and arguments presented in the course should be taken seriously. This wasn’t the crazy uncle on Medicare and Social Security (irony intended) venting personal frustrations on “The Government,” it was well thought out, evidence-based reasoning promoting libertarian thinking. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p style="line-height: 180%">I’ve been enjoying my current class, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/startup">Startup Engineering</a>, from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>. My own fascination for startup culture preceded the “Dot Com” era; I always admired people like Nolan Bushnell[1], Steve Jobs[2], and Bill Gates[3]. But I came of age during “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_bubble">The Bubble</a>” and hearing all of the sensational stories made me excited with what I might be able to become a part of as a young technologist. Even after the party ended and it seemed so obvious that most startup emperors had no clothes, I was still under the spell of people like Paul Graham whose <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">essays</a> and work at <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">YCombinator</a>[4] have influenced so many of us in our thinking about building businesses. </p>  <p style="line-height: 180%">One of the key points made by the Startup Engineering professor, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/balajis">Balaji Srinivasan</a>, is that there is a difference between a “small business” and a “startup.” The major difference has to do with the size of the market. According to the lecture notes: “<strong>Startups Must Exhibit Economies of Scale</strong>.” </p>  <p style="line-height: 180%">When I think about the companies I admire I realize that many don’t have enormous markets in a traditional sense[5]. I find myself admiring companies like <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/">Wolfram Research</a> for products like <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/?fp=right">Wolfram Alpha</a> or a gaming company like <a href="http://www.paradoxplaza.com/">Paradox Interactive</a> for publishing niche titles well known for their sophistication and obsessive community rather than mass market appeal. Both, if I’m not mistaken, are privately held which means that while neither is “small,” neither has to kowtow to short term demands of shareholders. </p>  <p style="line-height: 180%">Although I’m in learning mode at present I hope one day to build my own business selling software. It is, after all, the reason I took the course. But from a philosophical and temperamental side, this has helped me clarify my interests in something smaller than a conventional startup. I would rather take on an ambitious goal[6] in a small market than making a conventional concept “mainstream.” Worse yet, I wouldn’t want to build a sand castle product that is just designed to get a buck rather than make an impact. </p>  <p style="line-height: 180%">&#160;</p>  <p style="line-height: 180%">[1] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970475500/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0970475500&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=t3rse-20">The First Quarter : A 25-year History of Video Games</a><img style="border-top-style: none !important; border-left-style: none !important; border-bottom-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important; margin: 0px" border="0" alt="" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=t3rse-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0970475500" width="1" height="1" /> is a great history of early gaming.&#160; It was later edited and republished as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761536434/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0761536434&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=t3rse-20">The Ultimate History of Video Games: From Pong to Pokemon&#8211;The Story Behind the Craze That Touched Our Lives and Changed the World</a><img style="border-top-style: none !important; border-left-style: none !important; border-bottom-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important; margin: 0px" border="0" alt="" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=t3rse-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0761536434" width="1" height="1" /> but I&#8217;ve only personally read the former. </p>  <p style="line-height: 180%">[2] <a href="http://www.folklore.org/index.py">Folklore.org</a> is a great resource for stories around the early days of Apple and the building of the original Macintosh. </p>  <p style="line-height: 180%">[3] Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and many others are chronicled in Robert Cringely’s excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0887308554/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0887308554&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=t3rse-20">Accidental Empires: How the Boys of Silicon Valley Make Their Millions, Battle Foreign Competition, and Still Can&#8217;t Get a Date</a><img style="border-top-style: none !important; border-left-style: none !important; border-bottom-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important; margin: 0px" border="0" alt="" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=t3rse-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0887308554" width="1" height="1" />.&#160; </p>  <p style="line-height: 180%">[4] <a href="http://paulgraham.com/invtrend.html">According to Graham</a>, the valuation of companies incubated at YCombinator as of June 2013 was $11.7 billion.&#160; </p>  <p style="line-height: 180%">[5] By this I mean a lot of people.

  <div class="entry-content"><p style="line-height: 160%">I never thought I’d find myself saying it but my next computer is going to be a classic desktop machine; a “tower” as some of the gray bearded veterans of the “Build Your Own PC” era used to say. Although some people have preferred this type of machine my last 15 years (20 if you want to throw in college) have been spent on laptops. It’s been a practical decision: as a student I needed mobility to work in the library or in a class room, as a newly minted professional I had jobs that involved a lot of travel. And I liked working in coffee shops.</p>  <p style="line-height: 160%">Moving to a desktop feels in many ways like moving backward. As everyone and everything seems to get more “mobile first,” as there is more and more competition to build a smaller laptop with more battery life, it would seem like the action of a misty eyed classicist; the kind of guy who restores cars or listens to music from the 60s for the look and feel of a bygone era. </p>  <p style="line-height: 160%">But it’s the future that has moved me backward. Last year after <a href="http://www.t3rse.com/post/2012/12/31/The-Tablet-Wars-A-Personal-Account.aspx" target="_blank">much agonizing</a> I bought myself a Nexus 7 and the effect was that it became more and more of a rare need to move my laptop. The things I did – checking email, reading internets, watching screencasts – all not only were available on my tablet, but they were in many ways better[1]. </p>  <p style="line-height: 160%">As I come up on my 3 or so year upgrade cycle I’ve realized that in terms of bang for your buck, building a desktop machine is not only more economical, it comes with more power. Power is something I’ve always wanted but as I find myself more and more drawn to a “virtualize everything” approach to operating systems, it’s something I find myself needing. In a perfect world I run a virtualized OS for a work machine, another one for personal use, and several experimental VMs for running prerelease software and Linux[2]. These are all things I do with my laptop but there are better, cheaper options for optimizing CPU and memory on a desktop machine. </p>  <p style="line-height: 160%">The one element of my life that is perhaps a tipping point is that I no longer travel for work. This is the one element that might have continued the appeal for the powerful laptop I could move around with but as a remote worker who needs his home office for better bandwidth and privacy than could be achieved at a coffee house or library, it’s a chapter closed. Even with the most robust tablets out there, it seems like any serious undertaking involves a more traditional laptop or desktop computer. When my out of the ordinary travel or mobile scenarios show up I’ll still have one of my old laptops to fall back upon.</p>  <p style="line-height: 160%">I have to wonder how many people like me still buy laptops by force of habit but wind up doing most “mobile” tasks on a tablet or a phone. I also wonder if, once chained to a desktop, I’ll start to discover all sorts of scenarios when it would have been convenient to have a laptop instead. </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>[1] Fewer distractions on a single purpose screen, apps like <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/" target="_blank">Instapaper</a>, being able to multitask with real life (watching my toddler).</p>  <p>[2] Ubuntu for the most part although I realized a big reason I wasn’t doing any Windows 8 development was because I didn’t have the time or inclination to try to merge my heavily Windows 7 life with something new. It would have been easier to learn WinRT in parallel on a VM.</p>
