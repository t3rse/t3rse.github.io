<span style="font-size:180%;">{</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><em>Ruby on Rails</em> is getting more and more buzz each time I open my browser.  This time it was Bruce Tate </span><a href="www.zeldman.com/daily/1005i.shtml"><span style="font-size:85%;">claiming</span></a><span style="font-size:85%;"> that <em>Java</em> is dead ("like <em>COBOL</em>, not Elvis") and that he was turning to <em>Ruby on Rails</em> as his framework for application development.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">A few days ago I also noticed a </span><a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/10/13/what_is_rails.html"><span style="font-size:85%;">define/tutorial</span></a><span style="font-size:85%;"> on <em>Ruby on Rails</em> over at <em>O'Reilly</em>.  More and more of these seem to be popping up of late.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">The most interesting thing about this buzz, however, seems to be the shift in the pendulum swing to a language that is light and airy, one which isn't belabored by the stiffness of strong types.  </span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">I remember the process of learning <em>Java</em> - there seemed to be a lot of people coming from a <em>C/C++ </em>background who perpetually scowled at the <em>VB/Microsoft/Webby/Scripter</em> types like me.  Now many of this camp are turning away from that rigidity and heading back to the land of "dynamic" typing.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Pendulum swing... a few days ago I met with a prospective client and they showed me an app they were using that was written in <em>PowerBuilder</em>.  I don't know much about <em>PowerBuilder</em> but the app seemed quick, flexible, and tightly coupled with the database.  What's most ironic is that the reason I was there was to help with stored procedures and triggers that would let them add business logic to the otherwise light and airy environment in which their application came into being.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Deja vu, all over again.</span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">I've got <em>Ruby on Rails</em> on my watch list.  Go to the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">official website</a> and there's even a movie amongst the tutorials.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;">}</span></div>
