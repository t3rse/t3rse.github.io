<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />Each year, as many people gear up for their New Year's resolution that they will ultimately fail, I make my own doomed promise that this will be the year that I become proficient in perl.  As the year wears on I get more engrossed in project work and "lose" time.  Or I work on my own pet projects which I can prototype and finish so much more quickly in C#, or whatever else I know well.<br /><br />But my encouragement for the upcoming year's attempt is coming from all directions.<br /><br />One is <a href="http://www.yapc.org/America/">YAPC</a>, which will be in Chicago this year.  That's within reach, and it's not so expensive that I can't afford to be there.<br /><br />Another has been Josh McAdam's <a href="http://www.perlcast.com">perlcasts</a>.  While I'm at work moving pixels or writing C# I've been listening to quite a few prime hackers in the background.<br /><br />The second encouragement came from a post on Joel On Software about having a "night time" language:<br /><blockquote>"For the purposes of this argument I am assuming the programmer uses the language he likes best at night, and maybe not his favorite during the day.  If you wish to debate this, start another thread and I will.  Why does the programmer like the language that he likes at home so much?  I would argue that it is largely about efficiency in the language.  If you can do something quickly in a language you get that feeling of control that I think most programmers enjoy. " - <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.279945.12">threaded here</a><br /></blockquote>It's nice to know that other people out there feel as I do, and have their own "night" languages.<br /><br />Long live the night language. <br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >}</span><span style="font-size:130%;"> </span></div>

Now comes the part where I screen capture THE Randal Schwartz posting on my blog of nothing.  <BR/><BR/>You should know, Randal, that you're one of my professors; my llama book is well used and tattered.<BR/><BR/>You may also be amused that I went to school with Chris Nandor and even wrestled him once for possession of a remote control; he wanted to watch the Red Sox and I wanted to watch the Lakers.</div>
