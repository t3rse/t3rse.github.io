<span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />Toby Segaran, of <a href="http://www.tasktoy.com/">Lazybase</a> and <a href="http://www.tasktoy.com/">tasktoy</a> fame, <a href="http://blog.kiwitobes.com/70">recently emitted</a> the following on motivation:<br /><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>"The truth is that I don't make any money from these applications. They were never intended to be a business. I wrote them because I wanted them, it was an opportunity to learn something new, and like most people I love creating things. I determined that for less than I spend on coffee, I could put them online and share them with everyone."</blockquote>In a recent conversation with a person from work I spoke about <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/paper">an idea</a> for RSS aggregation I had that would be different from current tools but make for better use.  As cool as it was, I said, I doubted I could build a business model around it. When it was suggested I came up with the thought as a way of making money, it gave me pause -<br /><br />Not really, not at all, in fact. Things I write like <a href="http://www.t3rse.com/builder/">iTunesBuilder</a>, <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/antipod">antiPod</a>, <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/pwd">Hobbitwerk:::pwd</a>, <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/pi.aspx">Hobbitwerk::PIdigit</a>, <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/phoDak">phoDak</a> all had some personal problem or interest that prompted me to make them.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pekka_Himanen">Pekka Himanen's</a> book, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Hacker Ethic</span>, does well on this note by giving "Hacker" culture three main attributes (from Wikipedia, I'd suggest you actually read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/037575878X/sr=8-2/qid=1145722288/ref=sr_1_2/102-2569210-1553713?%5Fencoding=UTF8">the book</a>):<br /><blockquote>1. enthusiasm, passion about work that is enjoyed<br /><br />2. creativity, wish to realize oneself and one's ability, often in teams that are formed spontaneously (project orientation)<br /><br />3. wish to share one's skills with a community having common goals, along with the need to acquire recognition from one's "tribe"; one is motivated by inner zeal rather than external awards: the fruits of one's work are donated to everybody for their advances and further developments</blockquote>I would scarcely deign to mention myself in the same sentence as guys like Linus Torvalds or Toby Segaran, I understand this a lot from the stuff that I am trying to do. I'm hoping one of these days to have a good enough idea to make a contribution to programmers and people who use software.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">}</span> </span></div>
