<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />One of my jedi masters, <a href="http://www.markitup.com">Darren Neimke</a>, posted <a href="http://markitup.com/Posts/Post.aspx?postId=1ab79b38-4114-4428-b77f-623025081bae">the following</a> about having personal projects:<br /><br /><blockquote>"One of the questions that I always ask is for the applicant to tell me about their favorite personal project that they have going right now.  It's a bit of a loaded question I suppose because of how it assumes that they do have a personal project - but that's almost my point.  Having a personal project (or more than one) is a trait that is shared by every developer that I respect and so I rate it rather highly."</blockquote>Interesting, because my latest "personal" project is a tool I called <span style="font-style: italic;">Palantir</span> which let's the developers browse around the database getting schema information much more quickly and effeciently than writing queries like:<br /><br /><blockquote>select * from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'foo'<br />or<br />select * from information_schema.columns where column_name like '%foo%'<br /></blockquote>It pleasures me to no end when I walk through our work area and see it running on everyone's machines.  Usually in the evening I add features that are in response to feedback and what I think will make it more effective of a tool.  For example, one screen, devoted to exposing stored procedures, displayed TSQL without syntax highlighting and it became a request.  That evening I spent some time with regular expressions and search/replace to get a "pretty" version of procedure definitions into the software.<br /><br />Invariably the question of why I wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">Palantir</span> comes up, and my response usually a bit of surprise; I thought everyone had little pet projects of software they worked on at home.  In fact, most don't.  In fact, as I ask around, I find that I'm quite unique in that environment for working on my own stuff at home. <br /><br />I don't think it necessarily defines me as a better programmer but I know that it's when I write my own stuff that I get that free reign to improve my skills instead of working against a spec and a deadline.  My projects give me a chance to do things with regular expressions, backreferences, web services, RSS, XML, and a ton of other things that don't come up in the regular work day.<br /><br />I'm still considering what to do with <span style="font-style: italic;">Palantir</span>; I want to keep it personal for now so that I can work in some more features and leave it with my personal vision at its core.  Then I may work up the courage to put it up on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Default.aspx">CodePlex</a> or <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
