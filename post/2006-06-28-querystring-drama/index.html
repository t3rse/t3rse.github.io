<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />Apparently it's older news - a security feature from ASP.NET 1.1 that protects the webserver from "dangerous" querystrings that throws exceptions for illegal characters like angle brackets and so on.<br /><br />We happened upon it when trying to pass information from a VB6 application to a web app by putting together a querystring and appending it to the target page like so:<br /><br />http://foo/bar.aspx?id=29oeiu&0209&amp;wweoi9239<br /><br />The garbled bit after the ? was assembled by doing a little bit of shifting of character codes.   It doesn't really qualify as encryption but it seems daunting enough for the casual user and there's really not enough text for a persistent person to find much of a pattern.  Unfortunately as you happily shift those ascii codes you run into the "<" and other characters that ASP.NET 1.1+ is not happy about.   It makes the case for doing proper encoding but even true URL encoding (done by putting a "%" with the upper and lower 4 bits in the character byte encoded as hex) will not absolve the developer of the application server's squeamishness. For example, the URL encoded value for the left angle bracket, "&lt;", is %3c.  For the right angle bracket, ">" it is %3e.  So if you think that you might get away with a URL that should be http://foo/bar.aspx?start=&lt;&tag=h1&amp;end=&gt; by formating it as http://foo/bar.aspx?start=%3c&tag=h1&amp;end=%3e you will be sorely disappointed. Sorely.<br /><br />My colleague and I then thought we'd be a little clever - okay it was my [bad] idea -  and just use a constant character for one of the angle brackets but this also fell short since it's not just angle brackets that are considered dangerous.<br /><br />So what was the fix?  Step one is to leverage the might of Google and search on the error message.  Then we <a href="http://support.esri.com/index.cfm?fa=knowledgebase.techarticles.articleShow&d=26147">discovered</a> an attribute to the page processing directive that turns this feature off - it was almost too easy:<br /><br />ValidatePageRequest="false"<br /><br />Of course this puts the burden of securing the querystring on the developer but there are a few perks: first is that it only applies to the single page when placed as a directive.  The second is that the vulnerability is squarely on the developer leveraging the querystring for some back end command functionality.  That's easy to narrow into some clean validation logic.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
