<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />There is a saying among Africans: "When two elephants fight, it's the grass the suffers most."<br /><br />But fortunately this doesn't apply to the web; when two giants go at it, we get to tune in and watch the blow for blow, entertained.<br /><br />On Friday Joel Spolsky published <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01.html">The Language Wars</a>, in which he discussed an approach to picking a language/platform for application development. I believe his point had more to do with picking a well trodden path for a development project, as well as having an architect with lots of experience with your chosen platform/language.  Along the way, however, he said:<br /><br /><blockquote>... and a handful of platforms where The Jury Is Not In, So Why Take The Risk When Your Job Is On The Line? (Ruby on Rails). Before you flame me, Ruby is a beautiful language and I'm sure you can have a lot of fun developing apps it in, and in fact if you want to do something non-mission-critical, I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun, but for Serious Business Stuff you really must recognize...<br /></blockquote><br />The rest you can read in the post but these comments sparked a fire from Ruby on Rail's inventor, David Heinemeier Hansson who <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000596.html">retorted quickly</a> on his blog that Joel was full of FUD. It's an interesting exchange but Hansson points out that Joel's final thrust is about a language called Wasabi that is used at Fogbugz and completely outside the "well trodden path" or "proven platform" category he seems to espouse at the outset of the article.<br /><br />Soon after the rebuttle was posted there seemed to be a lot of people who thought Wasabi was a joke that Joel was using to wink at his like-minded classicists  with while stoking the fire of the Ruby hipsters - so much so that <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.383346.13">many posted</a> that they "got the joke" maybe in part to feel like they were the clever Ivy League programmers they assumed Joel left the easter egg for.<br /><br />But they were wrong, and Joel followed up with a post in which he confirmed the existence of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01b.html">Wasabi</a>, while backing away a bit from controversy by not rebutting the rebuttle. <br /><br />All in all, it was an interesting friday evening following this story around.  I never assumed Wasabi was an inside joke; Joel's mentioned many times that Fog Creek had a compiler they used to generate Fogbugz code in PHP and VBScript amongst other languages.  I didn't understand the big fuss on the part of Heinemeier Hansson either and others - the concept of a domain specific language written in something doesn't pull away its platform underpinnings.  If anything the platform is a safety net of sorts. But beyond this, the most important piece of the puzzle is Joel's second point: an architect is absolutely necessary for big, enterprise software (in order to do a good job).<br /><br />On the other hand I find Joel's skepticism toward Ruby on Rails as premature as the blind enthusiasm of many.  There is a lot of room between "Serious Business Applications" and college projects.  Many business applications are not mission critical banking - I just participated in a rewrite of a sales project management platform that could have been Ruby on Rails fodder. If anything there's going to be better, smarter business development tools as a result of the good ideas that Rails has fostered.<br /><br />Time to <a href="http://blogs.icerocket.com/search?q=%22Language+Wars%22">stay tuned</a> to the aftermath in the blog/web world.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">}</span> </span></div>
