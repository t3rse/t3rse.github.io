<span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I'm having an evening when I can't believe what is wrong with me because something that should be trivial is giving me hell.<br /><br />Our application has had connection strings littered all over the place - okay, 8 to be exact and I know this because of my frequent usage of "replace in files" to toggle connection strings. But we're at a point when this needs to be centralized and mutable without doing a new build.<br /><br />In my head this is simple: slap a config file into the project and off I go.  Some kind of one liner along the lines of:<br /><br />ConfLib.CONNECTION  = ConfigurationSettings.AppSettings["Connect"];<br /><br />Simple, right?  I do it with web applications all the time.<br /><br />The first issue is that ConfigurationSettings, which the old school .NET folks are used to, is deprecated.  The message tells you to use ConfigurationManager but neglects to mention that a physical reference to System.Configuration.dll (in the GAC) is needed.  This isn't a big issue and 2 minutes later I've referenced it, and rewritten my line of code as:<br /><br />ConfLib.CONNECTION  = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["Connect"];<br /><br />Not quite.  I'm now in the habit of doing unit tests so I realize that Visual Studio 2005 <span style="font-style: italic;">copies your libraries</span> to a new directory when it does unit tests.  I look at the "post build event" options and wonder if it's worth the hassle. So instead I ditch the unit test and return to the main solution, manually copy the *.config file into my application's directory and try.<br /><br />No dice.<br /><br />Maybe ConfigurationManager is too nebulous?  So I try the following:<br /><br />Configuration conf = ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration("ConfigHelper.dll");<br /><br />Which, when I run it in the debugger seems to pull my keys out of the config file but gives me an access violation when I try:<br /><br />ConfLib.CONNECTION  = conf.AppSettings["Connect"];<br /><br />This is quite some time later and I'm pretty annoyed because I must have absolutely not gotten the memo or configuration is bloated.  Almost to prove to myself how simple this should be, I create a file called Settings.xml and put in a couple of elements and write the following:<br /><br />XmlDocument configDoc = new XmlDocument();<br />configDoc.Load(Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "Settings.xml"));<br />ConfLib.CONNECTION = configDoc.SelectSingleNode("//Database/text()").Value;<br />ConfLib.VERSION = configDoc.SelectSingleNode("//Version/text()").Value;<br /><br />That simple.<br /><br />Granted I am WELL AWARE that the Configuration API has lots of goodies stuffed into it but should that make the process of pulling it out of a configuration file so convoluted?  Things that are designed well work for the simple things as easily as they solve the complex.<br /><br />My configuration files always have the same pattern: I create a class that is designed to read the xml file with static variables for each configuration value.  I use a static initializer to read these from the file and have a single static variable I reference when the app is loaded.  I've worked on a lot of stuff that benefits from this but almost always configuration stuff seems to boil down to a simple name/value pair you can leverage.<br /><br />I could have made an indexer and had the pulling look like the AppSettings collection on the ConfigurationManager but I dislike the fact that the compiler doesn't catch errors related to misspelled key names. <br /><br />Oh well, I'll leave it in its current state. Maybe I'll get the memo tomorrow but I doubt it.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
