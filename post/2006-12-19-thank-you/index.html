<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{ </span><br /><br />Time magazine selected "you" as person of the year with their definition of "you" encompassing people who posted user-generated content on the web. I wanted to pay tribute to all of the "you" out there who inform, motivate, and inspire me. My list is limited since I usually hit dozens of websites each week, but this is a list of the people who regularly reeled me in during the last year:<br /><br />Raganwald - <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">http://weblog.raganwald.com/</a><br />Thanks for the cut and dry honesty. Thanks for the delicious links.<br /><br />Joel Spolsky - <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/</a><br />I'm not a blue blooded programmer, educated at Yale, and you would be ashamed of how weak I am with C++ and pointers. But you give me an opportunity to learn and think about my craft. In the end I'm better for it.<br /><br />Drew McLellan - <a href="http://allinthehead.com/">http://allinthehead.com/</a><br />24 Ways. 'Nuff said.<br /><br />Scott Hanselman - <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/</a><br />You not only inform, you motivate. You're not arrogant. I can tell you're smart because you want to share the things you discover. You never make me feel like I went to the wrong school or that my pedigree is suspect, you focus on the technology. Your excitement is contagious.<br /><br />Dare Obasanjo - <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/">http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/</a><br />You keep it real.<br /><br />John Lam - <a href="http://iunknown.com/">http://iunknown.com/</a><br />You think different and still manage to be associated with Microsoft.<br /><br />Eric Sink - <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/">http://software.ericsink.com/</a><br />Practical and smart. Open about what it's like to be an ISV.<br /><br />Nate Koechley - <a href="http://nate.koechley.com/blog/">http://nate.koechley.com/blog/</a><br />My inside track to Yahoo! and a good resource for general web developer issues.<br /><br />Aaron Johnson - <a href="http://www.cephas.net/blog/">http://www.cephas.net/blog/</a><br />I can't believe that at one point you were my roommate and we never talked about programming. You're full of good stuff, I hope you never stop.<br /><br />Ted Leung - <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog">http://www.sauria.com/blog</a><br />Another of the "programmer's programmer" people I latched onto a while back and keep visiting. I like the quality of your thoughts which refreshingly venture from programming from time to time.<br /><br />Paul Graham - <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">http://www.paulgraham.com</a><br />You're my idealist. I usually get a sense of excitement when you post a new essay and then print it out to read over lunch or at coffee.<br /><br />Simon Willison - <a href="http://simonwillison.net/">http://simonwillison.net/</a><br />Another connection to Yahoo! and a jedi at <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2006/02/08/summit">taking notes</a>.<br /><br />Steve Yegge - <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com</a><br />Keeping it as real as Dare, from Google. Saying what a lot of people think but are scared to admit. Another person who is down the path from me, whose footsteps I'd like to follow.<br /><br />Larry O'Brien - <a href="http://www.knowing.net/">http://www.knowing.net/</a><br />Educated gentleman who kept me awake for a while trying to prove to myself that I <a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,f3b9ba36-848e-43f8-9caa-232ec216192d.aspx">know my language</a> (C#). I ported my Haar transform code to Java too. Also proof that you don't need to be in the throng of things because he's "holding it down" in Hawaii.<br /><br />Mad Kristensen - <a href="http://www.madskristensen.dk/blog/">http://www.madskristensen.dk/blog/</a><br />Another clever Dane, but very accessible to me. Every time I hit the site I learn something new that I can almost immediately use.<br /><br />Aaron Swartz - <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/</a><br />A smart kid. I can't concentrate through a lot of the stuff but every so often I find something darling. Maybe I should categorize this like a few I've mentioned above it as "good conversation" blogs or thoughts that inspire some thought.<br /><br />Sam Gentile - <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/default.aspx">http://codebetter.com/blogs/sam.gentile/default.aspx</a><br />A true blue Microsoftie. Staying on top of the blog keeps me on top, usually, of what I should be paying attention to from Microsoft: service packs, new releases, and so on.<br /><br />Ian Griffiths - <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/</a><br />Chris Sells's cohort in a recent WPF book and another good Microsoft-centric blog to keep a finger on the pulse.<br /><br />Chris Sells - <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/">http://www.sellsbrothers.com/</a><br />Another clever jedi master who cares enough to share what he knows from time to time. Author (along with Ian, above) of some pretty good books that I own. One thing Chris said from a podcast with Scott Hanselman that stayed with me toward the end of the year was (I'm paraphrasing) that the information age will show a gap between people who can absorb a lot of information and those who can't.<br /><br />Darren Niemke - <a href="http://markitup.com/">http://markitup.com/</a><br />IM Conversation:<br />David - test<br />Darren - I read you.<br />David - got a sec for a question... ?<br />It's a bit strange that I can have someone like Darren on my IM list to bother from time to time. I usually get emails from published authors but having one who bothers to answer questions from some guy in South Dakota is quite a priviledge. Great ideas, great blog.<br /><br />Mike Arace - <a href="http://mikeomatic.net/">http://mikeomatic.net/</a><br />Found as I searched for commentary on posts by Joel. After I'd put you in the aggregator I kept finding good stuff.<br /><br />Jason Haley - <a href="http://jasonhaley.com/blog/default.aspx">http://jasonhaley.com/blog/default.aspx</a><br />You are the future of what the Time magazine selection means; you're a new type of curator, posting signs that people like me can follow.<br /><br />Bart De Smet - <a href="http://blog.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/default.aspx">http://blog.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/default.aspx</a><br />A programmer's paradox. How on earth do you stay productive enough to be as relevant (which you do) and maintain enough time to communicate it? <br /><br />Reddit Kids - <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">http://www.reddit.com/</a><br />Not only user-generated content, but relevant by democracy. I've especially enjoyed <a href="http://joel.reddit.com">joel.reddit.com</a><br /><br />Digg - <a href="http://www.digg.com/">http://www.digg.com/</a><br />Almost as good as Reddit.<br /><br />Carl Franklin, Richard Campbell - <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/">http://www.dotnetrocks.com/</a><br />Love the podcast. I've got a love/hate thing going on with Carl's opinions, but I'm amazed that you keep it going and keep it as fresh as ever.<br /><br />Josh McAdams - <a href="http://www.perlcast.com/">http://www.perlcast.com/</a><br />Love this podcast as well. You're pretty "aw shucks" about it but honestly you're the best interviewer of the technical podcasts I listen to regularly.<br /><br /><a href="http://voelterblog.blogspot.com/">Markus Volter</a> et. al. at Software Engineering Radio - <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">http://www.se-radio.net/</a><br />Another great podcast from which to learn.  It's intriguing to catch the Europeanisms as well and to hear something a bit more formal. Many of the podcasts I downloaded I had to listen to multiple times, not because of different accents, but because the content was that deep.<br /><br />There are many other blogs, podcasts, and other online haunts that I gathered information (I'll pay tribute to the non-technical ones on my other blog) but every site listed above is a place I keep going back to and appreciating. I find it amazing that none of you have to do it and yet you keep on giving to your community. That's quite a gift.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
