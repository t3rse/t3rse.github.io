<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I've previously identified perl as my "night language." In other words, I'm hacking away at it in the off hours trying to get better. Maybe, just maybe, I will find a way to get paid for writing perl code.  As of now, however, I write C#/.NET code to put food on the table.<br /><br />As an exercise in perl, in order to demonstrate how fast it is, I wrote <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/LineCounter.txt">a small script</a> that would count the number of lines of code I was responsible for last year.  That's an easy task; I keep all the code I am working on for a given year in the same directory.  There are a few projects that span a year's end, but it's okay since there's a lot of code that is written that doesn't make it to my directory, and there is a lot of code I write that isn't C#, which is all I was counting in this instance.<br /><br />After a little tweaking, I had a script I felt happy enough with to point at my CODE06 directory.  I was fairly curious - the folder is about 650MB but a lot of that is binary stuff, everything from installers to compiled bits of projects.  My script - or perl, I should say - is unbelievably fast; when I changed output to a file it was able to run in less than a half minute.    The first run showed that there were ~160,000 lines of code in the directories *.cs files.<br /><br />Interesting - not an accurate estimate of things but 438 lines of code per day (160,000 / 365) and if you consider only business days (251), that's on the order of 637.5 per day.  I can hear the Herbert song playing <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Herbert/_/Something+Isn%27t+Right"><span style="font-style: italic;">Something Isn't Right</span></a> in my head at this point.<br /><br />I do use Visual Studio, and one of the points of interest for me was the difference in how much code I actually wrote and how much was generated.  Again back to estimating I excluded Visual Studio generated files from my project and that cut the number down to ~30,000 lines of code.<br /><br />This is very imprecise because there are some *.cs files which are generated but it still has the <span style="font-style: italic;">Something Isn't Right</span> going in my head because a little bit of help and organization from an IDE is fine, but the cost of 84% of output being machine generated is steep.<br /><br />It's an <a href="http://archive.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/05/cov_12feature.html">Ellen Ullman moment</a>; the realization that there are so many layers of abstraction between you and your tool - that you're unaware of all the hiding it does for you.  It's a reminder of a moment a while back when I was showing someone <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2006/10/commands-and-abstractions.html">how dangerous</a> letting a tool do something for you can really be.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/LineCounter.txt"><img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/LOC.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
