<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>I remember my first conference well: I was 24, it was February of the year 2000 and I was in San Francisco.&nbsp; I'd bartered my way there: I turned down a raise from my employer and instead asked for a "personal budget" for professional development.&nbsp;In a bookstore I'd seen an ad in the <em>Visual Basic Programmer's Journal</em> and thought it was an opportunity to develop skills and visit my favorite city at the time.</p> <p>One keynote that week was&nbsp;delivered by the futurist <a href="http://www.saffo.com/">Paul Saffo</a>. He spoke about observing trends and thinking past the day to day problem solving we experienced in our lives as programmers.&nbsp; I remember his anecdotal story: an engineer working in telecom had purchased land on hilltops knowing there would be a demand for communication towers on top.</p> <p>It's been nearly a decade but with Saffo in mind I still try to get out of the "technical" and think on a higher order.&nbsp; With that in mind here are a few podcasts from last week I enjoyed:</p> <p>1. Scott Berkun - <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1869.html">The Myths of Innovation</a></p> <p>Scott was a developer and manager at Microsoft but broke away to write and mentor. Key takeaway on innovation: breakthroughs are less about epiphany and more about consistent effort and dedication. Scott's blog is <a href="http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/">here</a>.</p> <p>2. Guy Kawasaki - <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1867.html">The Art of Innovation</a></p> <p>I've been wary of Guy to this point; marketing guy, and Apple obsessed. I like Apple too but not enough to start to ignore the outside world.&nbsp;But not only did I laugh and get entertained, I learned a few things. Guy recommends companies (and I'll extend that to people too) need a mantra, not a mission statement.&nbsp; He also has great ideas about releasing early and often.&nbsp; Good stuff.<br>Guy blogs <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/">here</a>.</p> <p>3. Ned Gulley - <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3325.html">MATLAB Programming Contest</a></p> <p>John Udell interviews Ned on an interesting <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/contest/overview.html">collaborative contest</a> Mathworks puts on.&nbsp; I always like hearing a John Udell interview since he probes with more than the passive interest than most people in conversation.&nbsp; Someday when I'm not bleeding a lack of time I'll check in on the problems although I think my math skills are suspect (and rusty) enough to render it more fascination than practical utility.<br>Ned's "starchamber" is <a href="http://www.starchamber.com/">here</a>. (I learned the meaning of that word from the Merriam-Webster <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwwodarch.pl?Feb.10.2007">Word of the Day</a> podcast by the way)</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1></div>

Yeah - If I think that was probably one of the key decisions I've made as in professional life which is crazy since I didn't really think that hard about it - that year I went to: <BR/><BR/>1. Java training with Developmentor<BR/>2. Java training with Oracle<BR/>3. VBITS (Visual Studio) Conferences (2000, 2001)<BR/><BR/>All for the value of what would have been a few extra hundred bucks that would be taxed heavily on my paycheck.</div>

> I'd bartered my way there: I turned down a raise from my employer and instead asked for a "personal budget" for professional development<BR/>-- That's spot on dude, I've had a couple people come up to me at my job and ask how they could get out of a support role and into engineering. Taking classes in lieu of a raise tells your employer that you're serious about your job. <BR/><BR/>Cheers,<BR/><BR/>AJ</div>
