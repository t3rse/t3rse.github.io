<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>I earned the reputation as "the guy from South Dakota" at CodeMash; many people were amazed that I took it upon myself to drive just under 14 hours both there and back for the conference.</p> <p>What would they have done if I told them I also:<br>a) took time off from work<br>b) paid for it out of pocket<br>c) drove my own car</p> <p>But I think it's not *that* strange. Staying at work would have meant the same old stuff I do every day all year and instead I got to see some of the best Einstein's presenting on Python, DSLs, Dojo, REST, and IIS7. I made some friends as well and on top of that got to kick it with Scott Hanselman.&nbsp; All for the cost of a long drive with an audio book.</p> <p>I had <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2007/12/codemash-i-be-there.html">posted</a> on sessions I wanted to see, here's a little rundown of memorable sessions I actually attended:</p> <p>1. <a href="http://www.nealford.com/">Neal Ford's</a> keynote "<em>Software Engineering &amp; Polyglot Programming</em>"</p> <p>Neal's one of those sedate cognoscenti who don't appear to have an emotional angle on platforms, just a sense of design and engineering that they wish to communicate.&nbsp; In his talk he urged developers towards the notion of language as a tool, and that dynamic languages take us places that our old friends in the static realm cannot.&nbsp; He made a reference to <a href="http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design_main.html">Jack Reeve's essay</a> which I've <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2006/06/code-as-design-implications-for.html">written about</a> before, and said a few times the following phrase which I thought was apt: <br>"Testing is the engineering rigor of software development." </p> <p>If I could have asked Neal, I'd have wanted some comment on something I posted some time back - Oliver Steele's blog post on <a href="http://osteele.com/archives/2004/11/ides">The IDE Divide</a> in which he divides developers into the Language Mavens and Tool Mavens.&nbsp; I think Neal's perspective was very much that of a language versus tool maven.</p> <p>2. <a href="http://catherinedevlin.blogspot.com/">Catherine Devlin's</a> "<em>Crash, Smash, Kaboom Course in Python</em>" <br>Great talk on Python fundamentals while illustrating a universe simulator library (forget the name).&nbsp; I've been trying to pick up Python for some time and much of what I got was from watching Catherine's use of the language in her demos.&nbsp; The one bummer: I was using a Python distribution from my iBook (Mac OSX) that didn't include the Python modules she was demonstrating with. Even more of a bummer: in my hotel room a different laptop was running Ubuntu with just the modules needed to follow along with her in code.</p> <p>3. <a href="http://www.blueskyonmars.com/">Kevin Dangoor</a> on Dojo<br>I may have made Kevin feel uncomfortable with how happy I was to see this talk (he did a great job) but I've felt quite alone over the last two-ish years working with javascript libraries.&nbsp; I used jQuery heavily for my tool "<a href="http://www.t3rse.com/proper/">proper</a>" after which I used Prototype/Scriptaculous for a few other projects.&nbsp; I then switched to YUI for <a href="http://www.nregex.com">nRegex</a> so I'd been around the block with my frameworks with only Dojo missing.&nbsp; Dojo seems to go beyond these other frameworks just on its ambition alone and I'm wondering if that can translate into a happy mix with the heavyweight stuff I have to do at work with ASP.NET.&nbsp; </p> <p>4. <a href="http://www.diditwith.net/">Dustin Campbell</a> on F#<br>Dustin gave a deft introduction to the F# language which had to be the biggest thoughtbludgeon I got during the conference.&nbsp; I've listed F# as <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2007/12/someday-language-f.html">my "someday language"</a> and it will remain so since Ruby will occupy my time along with Python in learning mode over the next year or so. Nevertheless, it was good to see a demonstration of the language and some of the implications thereof.</p> <p>5. Kevin Dangoor on Gears and Dojo (DojoX Offline)<br>The second session I sat in on with Kevin, this dealing with Dojo's offline capabilities in large part courtesy of Google Gears.&nbsp; It was as good as the first Dojo session and left my mind popping with ideas for leveraging that functionality.&nbsp; <br>Soon - I'd say around the release of Silverlight 2.0 - people like me are going to face a fork in the road of using browser plugins and thick (they use the word "rich") vendor technologies, or using javascript and existing web technologies like CSS on a new level.&nbsp; All the Dojo stuff represents, to me, what Microsoft and Adobe (no need to even mention JavaFX, oops I just did) are not tuning to as they ramp up Silverlight and Flex.&nbsp; Not that it's in their interests: the stuff of web standards isn't really the profit center that proprietary technologies are.</p> <p>6. Neal Ford on DSLs with Dynamic Languages<br>Neal was impressive this second time with some practical talk and examples of DSLs.&nbsp; He started first with Groovy, which left me disappointed since I don't anticipate using it, but to show the "best" world he switched to Ruby.&nbsp; I am really looking forward to IronRuby's release, but at present I think much of what he discussed can be implemented in Python.&nbsp; </p> <p>7. <a href="http://www.arcware.net/">Dave Donaldson</a> on RESTful Web Services<br>I've been familiar with the REST buzzword for some time but as a term thrown out in competition with standard web services (the WS-* stuff).&nbsp; Dave did a good job of unpacking the essence of REST and showing demonstrations of usage.&nbsp; It's interesting to see just how much backlash there is against WS-* and the manufactured complexity therein.&nbsp; <strike>The only thing I disagreed with was Dave belittling</strike> Dave expressed reservations about the <a href="http://astoria.mslivelabs.com/">Astoria</a> project teetering into the over-engineered realm of WS-* but I am hopeful it will retain its original intent - I really, really like the idea of Astoria (born of the same backlash to WS-*? I'm just talking here...).<br></p> <p>8. <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/blog">Scott Hanselman</a> on Mashups with IIS7<br>He has the gift and he knows it: first with a humorous prologue and then with a good presentation on IIS7 and using its underpinnings with a mix of PHP. Inspired by Bill Staples <a href="http://blogs.iis.net/bills/archive/2006/10/31/PHP-on-IIS.aspx">article</a> on IIS7 and PHP, but with the detail and demonstrations with which Scott's earned his following.</p> <p>I went to a few other sessions too, but these were the ones which, as the Brits say, "tickled my fancy."&nbsp; I was disappointed to miss out on <a href="http://jrwren.wrenfam.com/blog/">Jay Wren's</a> intro to Castle as well as <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=beckel">Bruce Eckel's</a> thoughts on Python. I guess there's next year... </p> <p>... and I do anticipate returning to CodeMash although I'm quite sure I'll fly rather than driving. :^)<br></p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

Modified accordingly, I hope I am more accurate with the edit. <BR/><BR/>I've got you subbed in my aggregator, so consider me a lurker now.</div>

Belittling Astoria was not my intent, as I have high hopes for that project as well. I just hope it can deliver and not be over-engineered like so many other things.<BR/><BR/>Anyway, glad you could make it to the show and maybe we can chat more next year.<BR/><BR/>--Dave Donaldson</div>
