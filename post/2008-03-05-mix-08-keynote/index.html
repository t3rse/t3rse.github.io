<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>Just <a href="http://www.visitmix.com/blogs/Joshua/Day-1-Keynote/">watched it</a> while working on some stuff tonight.&nbsp; Good things seem to be happening although much of it is in CTP or Beta form right now.&nbsp; I'll need to resurrect my VPC images to install and play when I have the time. What's baking that's cool?</p> <p>IE 8 - the integrated Firebug like debugging is what's got me excited for now.<br>Silverlight 2.0 - Dino Esposito joked about how Silverlight 1.0 was a declarative way to produce an animated gif (unless you just want a video player).&nbsp; Now that a real control library is being developed, people like me will be able to seriously think of ways to use it.&nbsp; I don't stream video but I do write a lot of code :)<br>Expression 2.0 / WPF - Ditto on Silverlight 2.0, WPF needs controls - and not just the kind you have to pay $$$ for.&nbsp; In my best Steve Balmer voice I'd say "controls! controls! controls!" The blank canvas thing is cool but limited when you need to build something on a real world timeline with real world resources.</p> <p>I didn't see ASP.NET MVC stuff in the keynote under demonstration but it was mentioned. Via Hanselman, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=38CC4CF1-773A-47E1-8125-BA3369BF54A3&amp;displaylang=en">Preview 2</a> is released today.</p> <p>John Lam seems to be writing <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silverl.html">a multi-part article on DLR + IronRuby</a> - a cool way to experiment with Silverlight although now I'm officially in love with Python and may not have room for a while.&nbsp; </p> <p>I'm excited to see what happens but I'm skeptical to put too much effort into this stuff until it's properly released.&nbsp; Since I'm no longer a trainer and the apps I write have to be installable on client machines, I have less flexibility and time to get full fledged into beta stuff. It will also be interesting to see who wins the Silverlight / Flash war (and a war it will be). Microsoft is building its installed base pretty fast and with a better developer toolkit I will be interested to see what Adobe does with Flash.</p> <p>Lots more lurking to do - even though <strike>all the</strike> cool people are at MIX, so much is online and so many people are twittering (I now have a "Twit" folder in my reader), one can almost imagine themselves there.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
