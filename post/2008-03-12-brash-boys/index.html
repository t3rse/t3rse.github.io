<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>When I read <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/16-03/mf_signals">the article on 37 Signals</a> in Wired, I admit I alternated between shaking my head, laughing, and sighing. </p> <p>When Hanson commented upon the term arrogance, I laughed: </p> <blockquote> <p>"Arrogant is usually something you hurl at somebody as an insult," Hansson said. "But when I actually looked it up — having an aggravated sense of one's own importance or abilities' — I thought, sure."</p></blockquote> <p>When the article describes him as a "philosopher king" I shook my head.&nbsp; And his response to naysayers, "F--- you" made me sigh; not a convincing piece of rhetoric at all.&nbsp; </p> <p>Despite all this, despite Atwood's <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001065.html">recent swipe</a> at what he calls "douchebaggery," despite the <a href="http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/why_is_37signals_so_1.html">disagreement</a> of Don Norman, there is something there.&nbsp; </p> <p>It's not that I'm one of the fanboys of the Ruby or Apple world, or that I agree with Hansson's attitude towards windows developers - it's that I think it's a trait of people I call successful to be able to concentrate and get things done without regard for outside opinions.&nbsp; It's less of a "stay the course" mentality than an understanding of self and drawing clear lines with work rather than spending a lot of time second guessing and self doubting. </p> <p>One area in which I can look at hard data and side with 37signals is in the realm of additional or complex features; I really do question whether they are worth it.&nbsp; I just recently quantified this with an application we wrote for a customer that they are using successfully.&nbsp; I compared the baseline functionality of a particular feature to some exceptional scenarios I had to write code for - it was easy because one can tell the usage by counting records in the database.&nbsp; Anyhow, for the baseline functionality I counted some 6,100 instances of its use.&nbsp; For the exceptional scenarios, I counted 9 entries.&nbsp; Here's the clincher: it took about 3 or 4 times as long to implement support for the exceptional scenarios (and it added a lot of complexity to the code for the baseline feature).&nbsp; So the ability to handle about one tenth of a percent of scenarios, cost and complexity was inflated significantly.</p> <p>Here's where I disagree with them: it's not my decision, it's the customer's. My goal should be to communicate that trade off as well as I can.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
