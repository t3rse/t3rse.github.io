I'm not shy to boast on their behalf.&nbsp; In the same way a lot of these old books are like old friends that have seen me through some pretty turbulent times.&nbsp; I carried Francesco Balena's <em>Programming Visual Basic 6.0</em> around for years when I was training people on VB6, COM, and ASP.&nbsp; Another set of heavy books I spent many a quality night in a hotel room with were Gary Cornell's <em>Core Java</em> and <em>Core Java Advanced Features</em>. I don't have a formal computer science education but I consider a large part of my education the 7 or so years I spent on the road, in various hotel rooms, reading and practicing what I needed to know.</p> <p>If truth be told there are a few there that I didn't get much out of.&nbsp; I never did run <a href="http://www.slashcode.com/">Slashcode</a> and I never did more than tinker with Bryce.&nbsp; But I'm not ashamed to say that I had hopes of doing so that time supplanted with other things.</p> <p>I packed them away and made room for some of the books I have piled on top of the shelves.&nbsp; Since I don't travel much and remain in project mode I'm not as efficient about reading what I have but a smaller shelf is more tidy and palatable.&nbsp; I won't wait so long before my next big cleanup.</p> <p>So the big question: what to do with these books?</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

I've sent off some with BookMooch.  I don't feel bad about accumulating them, though, b/c I read them too.</div>
