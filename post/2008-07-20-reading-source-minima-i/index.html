<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>I'm interested in the notion of deliberate practice as it relates to software developers.&#160; How do we &quot;practice&quot; effectively?&#160; One of the things I've been wanting to be more serious and deliberate about was reading source code.&#160; Hanselman has inspired me with his &quot;weekly source code&quot; posts and since good ideas are worth copying I'll start to document some of the projects I download and look into for examples of good code.</p>  <p>The project I'm currently working on involves a lot of WCF. I've got mixed feelings (as well as a lot to learn) about it so I thought I'd start off by running <a href="http://www.netfxharmonics.com/2008/05/Minima-30-Released">Minima</a>, Dave Betz's WCF/.NET 3.5 blog engine as a sample of an end-to-end application I can model my own WCF architectures after.&#160; </p>  <p>Minima was not easy to get going. While I'm perhaps not the brightest kid on the block, the biggest item I struggled with would probably be a challenge to anyone: the certificates used in the WCF security model. While Betz has <a href="http://notgartner.wordpress.com/2007/09/06/using-certificate-based-authentication-and-protection-with-windows-communication-foundation-wcf/">a blog entry</a> documenting the basic usage of certificates with WCF, it is predicated on the WCF host not being IIS. For the blog I assumed everything should be deployed to IIS and ran into the a lesser known fact that one must use the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/thankyou.aspx?familyId=c42e27ac-3409-40e9-8667-c748e422833f&amp;displayLang=en#">Windows HTTP Services Certification Configuration Tool</a> to enable the ASPNET account access to the certificates for their usage. There were also a couple of post build events in the project that I removed after getting my references set up.</p>  <p>But before I get into particulars, I wanted to go over the broader structure of the project.&#160; The Minima solution has the following projects:   <br />* Minima.Service    <br />This has the service and data contracts with no implementation    <br />* Minima.ServiceImpl    <br />This has the implementation of the service    <br />* Minima.Configuration    <br />A configuration helper which makes use of a library called Themelia (Betz is, apparently, a Biblical Greek scholar on the side)    <br />* Minima.Web    <br />Library for the blog website's features    <br />* Website    <br />A website project    <br />* Website Service project (exposes services for posting content to the database via WCF)</p>  <p>I'll write about more particulars in my next post but for this overview my biggest takeaway in the project structure is decoupling.&#160; Separating the service from the service implementation, separating the website from it's functionality by a project with the only purpose of implementing that backend logic, and separating general purpose frameworks like Themelia (for reading the config file etc).</p>  <p>When I start my own projects I usually think too much about doing a proof of concept and less about decoupling the overall structure. As a result most projects start off as a &quot;sketch&quot; in a single Visual Studio project and by the first release end up staying that way on a permanent basis. But perhaps what we should focus on as programmers is less the cleverest algorithms and more the most elegant structure for building solid applications.</p>  <p>Next stop: WCF and Generics.</p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
