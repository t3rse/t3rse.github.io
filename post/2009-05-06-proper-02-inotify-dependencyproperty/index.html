<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>Several years ago, in a land of Visual Studio 2005 and no CodeRush, I made a tool called <a href="http://t3rse.com/proper">Proper</a> to automate the monotony of creating properties. You just type something like “int Foo;string Bar;” and you’d get basic property generation. You can use shortcuts to types by typing an undercore “_” character. For example, “i_” will pop up int, “dt_” would pop up DateTime (<a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2007_04_01_archive.html">You can also create your own</a>). It’s funny how the stuff that you’re half serious about can last so long – at the time I wanted to write something useful entirely in JavaScript and to experiment a little with JQuery. </p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: gray 1px solid; border-left: gray 1px solid; border-top: gray 1px solid; border-right: gray 1px solid" src="http://seruyange.com/metadeveloper/Proper4179-simple.png" /> </p>  <p>The tool suffered neglect for the next few years until recently when I began working with Silverlight and was amazed at how a similar monotony (and more code!) accompanies using INotifyPropertyChanged and implementing dependency properties. I remembered my old tool and added support for generating them there. Here are some screenshots that should illustrate how it works (you select “advanced options” and then select a few checkboxes, in a nutshell). I’ll update the feature to report bugs – I’m sure there are a few. I also neglected to update it for VB.NET – I’ll do that over the next few weeks.</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: gray 1px solid; border-left: gray 1px solid; border-top: gray 1px solid; border-right: gray 1px solid" src="http://seruyange.com/metadeveloper/Proper4179-INotify.png" /> </p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: gray 1px solid; border-left: gray 1px solid; border-top: gray 1px solid; border-right: gray 1px solid" src="http://seruyange.com/metadeveloper/Proper4179-Dependency.png" /> </p>  <p>If you do spot a bug, let me know. There are a few new goals I have with the tool, the first of which is refactoring some of the embarrassing JavaScript I crufted together to make this work. I remember <a href="http://www.blueskyonmars.com/">Kevin Dangoor</a> talking about Embarrassment Driven Development (when your code is so embarrassing that you’re motivated to update it); that’s the one thing about JavaScript – you can’t hide the way things are constructed. :)</p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

Hey Dave, <br /><br />Thanks for the questions, I&#39;ll try to be brief and avoid &quot;one time at band camp&quot; stories... :)<br /><br />&gt; Why not use VS Snippets<br /><br />It&#39;s a valid alternative - something tells me a majority of developers prefer to stay in VS. There are a few reasons I went down this alternative path which may or may not resonate with other developers: <br /><br />1. The built in snippets require a &quot;one by one&quot; approach. You&#39;d need to type in prop A, B, C sequentially. This approach is &quot;batched&quot; in that you set everything up and then generate the code. <br />2. Snippets involve more typing. At the time I made this tool you&#39;d need to tab through 3 items on a snippet: type, private member, and property name. This uses a convention to allow you to type less and get more faster.<br />3. Customized snippets tether a person to an installation of Visual Studio (or customizing each one they touch). Because I am constantly developing across several machines and because I don&#39;t like tying myself to an instance of Visual Studio, that&#39;s another reason I do a lot of webby type tools like this.<br /><br />&gt; Why not output a CodeDom object<br />That&#39;s an interesting concept. I think I&#39;d be leaving the world of JavaScript but it could be much more flexible in the end. Perhaps an Ajaxy implementation where the CodeDom stuff lived on the server  would be apropos. <br /><br />&gt; dep props are only necessary for the TARGET of a data binding the the DubPeeEff/&quot;web killer&quot;<br /><br />You&#39;re right in the above although as I&#39;ve been building more UserControls that are templates for displaying data within the context of some larger list bound control (ItemsControl/DataGrid/etc) I see the need cropping up more and more. <br /><br />&gt; What is the answer to life, the<br />&gt; universe, and everything?<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkbdP7sq0w8</div>

Nice idea... few questions though (I promise the fourth one is easy):<br /><br />We could talk for hours why this isn't easier to do withe the lang primitives... but in the meantime people (using VS) could use code snippets for a more integrated experience... why not do it as snippets?<br /><br />To address the lack of VB support... why not output a CodeDom object and leave it to a language provider to write the code... that is, recently I discovered the XsdDataContractImporter class that lets you take a set of XML schema documents and generate a CodeCompileUnit which is then sent to a code provider that does the "semi-harry" details of writing code (give me a little room here... I might have gotten a few class names wrong, I didn't verify it all, it's "Memory Driven Development"). I realize you've got a website here and CodeCompiieUnit probably isn't a serializable types... but you could probably stop the "strcat" and move to the CodeDom (assuming you are doing strcat... "Assumption Driven Development")?<br /><br />As I understand it (mem driven dev again) dep props are only necessary for the TARGET of a data binding the the DubPeeEff/"web killer" (aka Silverlight) world so why bother... just make the source props INotifyPropertyChanged (don't "ultra"-long interface names make you think something is inherently wrong) instead?<br /><br />What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?</div>
