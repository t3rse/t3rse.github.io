Based on our conversations I&rsquo;ve decided to catalog my habits around listening to podcasts. Not to navel gaze for its own sake, more because I&rsquo;m curious about what YOUR habits are and what the more broader trends are beyond my sample size of 1.
I use Pocket Casts for just about everything because it&rsquo;s on my phone and I take my phone everywhere (even jogging)....</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Over the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve been looking into client side frameworks for the web. Almost everyone I know laments the proliferation of frameworks and &ldquo;noun.js&rdquo; modules in existence and yet we can&rsquo;t help ourselves. The snowball keeps rolling forward with new layers of granularity and complexity - language transpilers, package managers, browser adoption&hellip;

I won&rsquo;t forget that experience or the keynote from Paul Saffo, a futurist who exhorted us to look beyond our technological present and to try to anticipate and respond to trends.
It was not completely my own efforts but something must have stuck: learning about vtable binding and COM was useful but I also realized that I needed to do everything I could to get involved with web development....</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>I visited New York for the first time when I was still based in a Southern California exurb. It was overwhelming, beginning with the clear memory of a man yelling at me to get out of his way upon exiting an elevator.

When I got a new Mac earlier this year, my first reaction was to its beauty....</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>Although I switched to Octopress via inspiration from Staxmanade&rsquo;s blog series on exporting content from Blogger, my current blogging has been with BlogEngine.net. Here is how I migrated the content over.
*Export to BlogML*
The first task was to export my current blog entries. You can generate a BlogML file with all of your posts with the following steps:
 Log into the administration portal then choose Settings. On the subnavigation select the &ldquo;Import &amp; Export&rdquo; option....</p></div>

						<div class="post-summary"><p>I&rsquo;ve been through a lot of blogging engines. My first blog was built on the Radio Userland platform, created by Dave Winer who technorati know as the guy (controversially) behind RSS. I&rsquo;ve used Das Blog, Blogger, and BlogEngine.net. I&rsquo;ve used Tumblr. I&rsquo;ve even implemented my own lightweight blogging platform in the past. It&rsquo;s interesting how the concept of blogging is so simple but the platforms and tools are anything but. Perhaps it has to do with what I will call the &ldquo;Todo List Software Principle&rdquo; - the more generalized a problem set, the more variety and churn will exist for technical solutions....</p></div>

 Nugget from Peter Van Dijck. So the question is: when do you add a new feature?

After learning that not only was 2011 was prime, but that it was the sum of consecutive primes, I sought to write some C# code that would demonstrate this.

Tim Heuer has a great intro post on Silverlight data binding and value converters. The concept is a really nice one but I’m not wild about having to write a class that implements the IValueConverter interface every time I need some ad-hoc tweaking of the values I get from being data bound and how I’d like to use them within XAML. What set me off this track was a case where I simply needed to invert a boolean – what should just be “not myvalue” ended up requiring a class, an interface, and so on....</p></div>

&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://yui.yahooapis.com/combo?2.5.2/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js&amp;2.5.2/build/animation/animation-min.js&amp;2.5.2/build/element/element-beta-min.js&amp;2.5.2/build/container/container_core-min.js&amp;2.5.2/build/menu/menu-min.js&amp;2.5.2/build/button/button-min.js&amp;2.5.2/build/connection/connection-min.js&amp;2.5.2/build/datasource/datasource-beta-min.js&amp;2.5.2/build/datatable/datatable-beta-min.js&amp;2.5.2/build/tabview/tabview-min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 

Hm... a bit better. Both Dav and Eric confirm that the canonical solution to this problem is to spend some quality time at the YUI Configuration Site which will allow you to pick the widgets and utilities you've leveraged in order to combine it into a more simplified call....</p></div>

Mary Joe Foley presents a noncommittal analysis and Sam Ruby points to a few resources.
I went to Sun's page and although it seems like a real enough project the fact that it's applet based right now (and far slower than the Silverlight beta in installing) seems to point to it as an unfinished thought....</p></div>

It probably isn't surprising that most of these sites run on Linux with Apache and MySQL involved somewhere on the back end. I'm surprised (of course I'm not in the LAMP game though) to see a bit of a surge in the use of Lighttpd - a more lightweight serving engine than Apache....</p></div>

Continues with a little more elegance:
if(String.IsNullOrEmpty(Request.QueryString["foo"])){

Finishes with a check on type integrity during the querystring check:
if(!String.IsNullOrEmpty(Request.QueryString["foo"]) &&amp; 
Request.QueryString["foo"].length == 5){

One thing that gives me delight to no end is making tools that help people around me. I guess that's why I'm a software developer. Or, I guess, that's why I enjoy being a software developer.
I've worked on a few types of code generators to date, the idea of course being to save time when people have to do repetitious or monotonous tasks. Another big idea I've had was inspired by David Heinemeier Hansson's talk at Carson Workshops where he talked of the notion of convention over configuration (linked here in the context of spring, but a general enough design pattern)....</p></div>

A good essay I finally got to last weekend is Eric Sink advocating code coverage. Code coverage is simply understanding how much of your code is executed within your application. For people like me who start off by sketching, revising, and honing their work, I'm sure an analysis of parts of dead code would be quite revealing. But there were two other peripheral things about this essay that were very interesting to me....</p></div>

Last week I went back and forth with either using NUnit, which I'd be more inclined to do on my own versus Visual Studio Team's built in testing capability. I chose Visual Studio just because it would be easier for team members to get to; I can't look over everyone's shoulder and force them to write tests but I can make it as easy as possible to encourage the behavior....</p></div>

You can watch the entire keynote here, many a good thought. Some interesting thoughts:
1. Ruby on Rails, as an opinionated framework with limited focus is good.
2. Fast development cycles are good, better than Big Design Up Front.
3. People think in the mistaken trade off of quick & dirty (VB, PHP) and "enterprise." Just because something was done quickly doesn't mean it's dirty.
4. Keep programmers and customers in close quarters, combine with quick release cycles and allow for observation of how software is used....</p></div>

The timelag on posts is due to several 4 hour nights in succession while partaking in the festivities at TechEd.Here is a quick recap of Monday.
First session was WPF presented by Rob Reylea.WPF seems to be coming together more and more; Rob demonstrated new controls and old controls with new features: the listbox is quite a standout – textboxes that support spellchecking, controls having the ability to embed any other controls (button in a button)....</p></div>

I’d been looking forward to the keynote for a while since I found out that Ray Ozzie was going to be speaking. Unfortunately his piece of things was quite small – I imagine I wasn’t the only person disappointed by this. The meaning of the keynote was the general direction and strategy of Microsoft and how we “IT people” fit into that.
It made me think a lot of Macintosh ads and how differentiated the corporate strategies of Microsoft and Apple differ....</p></div>

One thing I'm very interested in hearing about at TechEd is going to be the Microsoft Atlas framework. Ajax is haute couture and Atlas seems to be at the center of Microsoft's strategy. On my current project I took a look at using Atlas but never really "got" the benefits of the technology. The declarative side of things seems to be designed for the IDE, and without the IDE here it's a bit of a non-intuitive hassle to hand code things out....</p></div>

Service Oriented Architecture is really a tool more focused on enterprise IT. It's for exposing a companies "business logic" through software. It's not really a concept for applying to a stand alone application like fogbugz or Word or whatever.

In short I’m hopeful because something that valuable and so passionately used won’t just disappear. This represents an opportunity for all of us who consider ourselves innovators to build something to fill the gap without Google Reader....</p></div>

My own fascination for startup culture preceded the “Dot Com” era; I always admired people like Nolan Bushnell[1], Steve Jobs[2], and Bill Gates[3]. But I came of age during “The Bubble” and hearing all of the sensational stories made me excited with what I might be able to become a part of as a young technologist. Even after the party ended and it seemed so obvious that most startup emperors had no clothes, I was still under the spell of people like Paul Graham whose essays and work at YCombinator[4] have influenced so many of us in our thinking about building businesses....</p></div>
