<span style="font-size:180%;color:#330099;">{</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Hello,<br /><br />My name is David. I live in Sioux Falls, SD as a recent transplant from southern California. I'm a programmer of sorts. "Of sorts" means that right now I'm between many things...<br /><br />A long time ago I started </span><a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/blog"><span style="font-size:85%;">blogging</span></a><span style="font-size:85%;"> about technical stuff but it soon became obvious that the people who read my blog were my friends, not my technie cohorts. So things evolved into an open letter which has never ended.<br /><br />I still like to write about programming, computers, and the technical. I also like the idea of maintaining a technical journal of where I've been and what I've struggled to get past as a programmer.<br /><br />This blog is about my technical life. Hopefully it will be interesting. Perhaps even, it will become useful.<br /></span><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#000066;">}</span></div>
