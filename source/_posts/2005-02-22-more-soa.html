It's for exposing a companies "business logic" through software. It's not really a concept for applying to a stand alone application like fogbugz or Word or whatever.<br /><br />If you're a company who has a business such as finance, healthcare etc, you have an IT department who has built custom software which contains your business logic. For many reasons you want to expose that business logic in a generic way so that it can be easily consumed:<br />1) by other pieces of internal software<br />2) by external software of your clients<br />3) by partner companies or companies your might merge with<br />etc...<br /></blockquote><br />And it stands as an important question exactly what type of software one is writing then; I agree that in many organizations SOA (I've worked at gigantic places like <span style="font-style: italic;">Intel</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Countrywide </span>and they surely have use for it) is important but I find it hard to believe that it would be as ubiquitous... I'm going to take a back seat and start studying the architecture more and comparing it to the work I've already done and seen in the "enterprise."<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
