<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />Yesterday I found a link to<a href="http://classicvb.org/petition/"> a petition</a> of VB developers, many of whom are MVPs, demanding that Microsoft not abandon the language/tools that served them well for so many years.  I thought it was interesting because it went along much of the thread of "<a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2005/02/soa-and-avalon-xaml.html">why not a better COM?</a>" which I'd started on earlier.<br /><br />Today I found <a href="http://www.danappleman.com/index.php?p=35">Appleman's comments</a> on it; it appears that his take is that of <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/default.aspx">Don Box</a> -  VB and COM are <span style="font-style: italic;">done</span> not <span style="font-style: italic;">dead</span>. <br /><br />Which is sort of interesting; there was a lot that could have been done to make classic VB even better and it's as useful now as it ever was (except for fear that it may become unsupported).<br /><br />What were some of the things that could have been better?<br /><ul>   <li>An enhanced IDE</li>   <li>More advanced controls (better menus, better toolbar, lists, better browser/net controls)</li>   <li>New language constructs and datatypes (compound assignment, collection classes, etc)</li>   <li>COM cleanup (less reliance on the registry OR better tools for managing it, builtin version management).</li> </ul> There are many other things I could think of but it suffices to say that with a better classic VB we'd no doubt experience less "energy" about WinForms with the .NET framework.<br /><br />Anyhow, this seems almost passe for the likes of me. On to XAML and whatever else bleeds "new."<br /><br />The petition has inspired quite a few retorts <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/03/08.html#a9568">here</a>, <a href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2005/03/10/7951.aspx">here</a>, and <a href="http://swigartconsulting.blogs.com/tech_blender/2005/03/just_plain_wron.html">here</a>.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
