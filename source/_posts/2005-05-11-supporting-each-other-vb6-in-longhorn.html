<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2005/03/done-not-dead.html">posted</a> a bit ago about Microsoft's MVP revolt with regards to supporting VB6.  They've responded in kind with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbrun/">VBrun</a>, "Visual Basic 6.0 Resource Center."<br /><br />The product manager for Visual Basic, Jay Roxe, responded to the petition <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/JRoxe/">on his blog</a> and, most importantly, has acknowledged support for VB6 in Longhorn:<br /><blockquote></blockquote>"However, I want to highlight to you that Microsoft is still supporting Visual Basic 6 and will continue to for quite some time.  In fact, the Visual Basic 6 runtime is slated to ship as a part of Windows Longhorn, which means that it will be covered under Longhornâ€™s support lifecycle."<blockquote></blockquote>I'm an<span style="font-weight: bold;"> unapologetic lover of VB6</span>, and find myself still using it all the time for helpful utilities.  Most recently I wrote a tool using the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/sdk/itunescomsdk.html">Apple iTunes COM SDK</a> to sync my physical arrangements of mp3s and folders with the playlists that it created. It's a nifty tool, and I'll post about it soon along with source code.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
