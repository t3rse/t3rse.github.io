<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;">Generated during class with South Dakota State employees but hopefully useful to anyone who wanders this way.<br /><br />[<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">NOTE: My web host doesn't serve the *.java files, so download the zipfile at the end of this post instead. I'll rename with *.txt later.</span>]<br /><br />We began things with a Hello World program in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Hello.java">Hello.java</a>. Soon after we talked about defining classes, the basic building block of any java program. <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Clerk.java">Clerk.java</a> shows an example of a class with fields, methods, getters and setters (accessor methods), and a constructor. Along the way we also learned about overloading, as seen in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Calculator.java">Calculator.java</a>.<br /><br />We learned more details about class definitions: <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Clock.java">Clock.java</a> (check with <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/TestClock.java">TestClock.java</a>) and <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Employee.java">Employee.java</a> are examples of how you can chain constructors. <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/BankAccount.java">BankAccount.java</a> was used to show the difference between static and instance methods and fields.  You can see the BankAccount class tested in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Thursday.java">Thursday.java</a>.  Once we were comfortable with the static keyword, we talked about defining constants, using <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Constants.java">Constants.java</a> as our example.<br /><br />We had a chapter that covered arrays, in which we looked at <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/UsingArrays.java">UsingArrays.java</a>. I added an aside about Collection classes in java, which are a more robust alternative to arrays in most cases, and we looked at <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Swapmeet.java">Swapmeet.java</a>. Even though I got the bubble sort wrong in class, it's fixed in this example with some helper methods, sortMyArray and printArray. We looked at working with Calendars and dates in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/TestBed.java">TestBed.java</a>.  I also included a <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/DateDiff.java">DateDiff.java</a> that shows how to get the functionality of a basic DateDiff command.  Like other things, it's ugly in java.<br /><br />You saw one class from the swing library, the JOptionPane, which was used to talk about getting user input. I also showed you the BufferedReader along with it in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Dialoging.java">Dialoging.java</a>. I would recommend the BufferedReader approach if your application runs from the command line, personally. For most other examples in class, we used <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/EasyConsole.java">EasyConsole.java</a>, which abstracted reading and writing from the console with a few simple methods.<br /><br />At this point we began to cover inheritance.  We looked at a basic inheritance heirarchy in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Person.java">Person.java</a>, <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/InhEmployee.java">InhEmployee.java</a>, and <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Executive.java">Executive.java</a>.  We looked at abstract classes in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Shape.java">Shape.java </a>and we briefly looked at interfaces in <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/IPrintable.java">IPrintable.java</a>.<br /><br />We closed out with the basics of exception handlers and subclassing exception. The try{..}catch{...}finally{...} is probably best introduced by your material.<br /><br />Our final two topics were File I/O and parsing XML documents.  On the File I/O side, I had two classes: <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/DavidFileReader.java">DavidFileReader.java</a> to demonstrate methods of reading from a file stream, and <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/DavidFileWriter.java">DavidFileWriter.java</a>, to demonstrate writing to a file stream.  In terms of XML, I have a class called <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Xreader.java">Xreader.java</a> which should help you get started parsing XML files.<br /><br />Wow, that was a lot for three days. Even typing it out makes me tired. In regards to the samples, you can download them individually, or you can <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/metadeveloper/PierreJava/Classfiles.zip">download a zip archive</a> of the entire set.
