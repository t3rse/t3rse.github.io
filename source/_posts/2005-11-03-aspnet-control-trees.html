It displays all the controls on an ASP.NET Page in a tree structure. You can actually call it from any control, it will recursively traverse the heirarchy below it. I tested it on ASP.NET 2.0, and it works fine:<br /><br />Call it with the following:<br /><br />DisplayControlTree(this.Controls, 1, 30);<br /><br />Incidentally, the problem I had (and still have) comes from dynamically loading User Controls. Once they've been loaded using <em>LoadControl("... path")</em> they don't seem to persist themselves in the ViewState. I think my best hope for now is to save entries made to the User Controls by parsing the Querystring or Form collection manually. </span><span style="font-size:85%;"><br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#000099;">}</span><br /><br /></span><span style="font-size:85%;"></span><span style="font-size:85%;"></span></div>
