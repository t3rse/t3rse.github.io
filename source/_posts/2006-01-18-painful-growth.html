<span style="font-size:180%;color:#000099;">{</span><br /><br />Raganwald has an <a href="http://www.braithwaite-lee.com/weblog/2005/01/what-ive-learned-from-failure.html">excellent essay</a> on failure in software development. In a world where everyone seems to be talking about how programmers ought to be smart, this is a dose of reality in which we realize that the line between success and failure depends on so much more.<br /><br />I've been on two failed projects.  Each time there's a bit of painful growing. I know I'm not alone; there's that statistic of the majority of software projects failing; but I like honesty and candor with the attempt to become better.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#000099;">}</span></div>
