<span style="font-size:180%;color:#000099;">{</span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel Spolsky</a> has begun a new series on design. I'm looking forward to it because I find myself having to refocus on the discipline of good design quite often.<br /><br />The one thing I have begun to understand about design is that in order to do a good job you've got to be absolutely tenacious.  If it means *exactly* 172 pixels, you use every means necessary to use 172 pixels. Not 171, nor 175, exactly 172.<br /><br />His first article, "<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/design/1stDraft/01.html">What is Design?</a>", does a good job of dispelling the myth that design is something mystically done by "artsy" people.  It will be interesting to see where he goes from there.<br /><br />I managed to get the company where I did my last project to use <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/index.html">Fogbugz</a>, Joel's bug tracking software.  At the time it seemed like simplistic software - I had a hard time believing that this "guru" of software development only had Fogbugz to show for himself.  However, I've been able to understand more of the design behind Fogbugz now; we use <a href="http://www.serena.com/Products/teamtrack/Home.asp">Serena Teamtrack</a> and although it *seems* like it has more functionality, it's missing a lot of the ease, flexibility, and philosophy of Fogbugz.  The best designs are like the best special effects in a film; they are so good you don't realize they are there.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#000099;">}</span></div>
