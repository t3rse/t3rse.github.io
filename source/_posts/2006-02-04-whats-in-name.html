<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />Apparently there is an <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1178.html">RFC on naming conventions</a>! Here is <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.304104.29">the thread</a> is on JoS. Gadgetopia also had a <a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/4608">thread</a> concerning the naming of things.<br /><br />I've always liked more creative naming conventions, even though an argument can be made for the sensible but boring "Computer01"... type approach. <br /><br />My machines were named after places in Middle Earth, like Minas Tirith and Isengard.  Pretty soon I'm going to have to clean things up and the new names will probably have some vague reference to Neal Stephenson (Raven, Hiro, Ng, ...). But that's probably something hard to explain to the Judy in accounting types.<br /><br />I'm glad scientists and discoverers are creative with their names.  The solar system, our human anatomy, different species, all are named well, and not "XXX01", "XXX02", "XXX03."<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
