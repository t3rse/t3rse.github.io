<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I first got this vibe from Jason Freid of <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37 Signals</a> while listening to a podcast from <a href="http://www.venturevoice.com/">Venture Voice</a> (I'm not that into VV; it's a bit too "MBA" for my more technical tastes - I found msyelf there only because Joel Spolsky was interviewed).<br /><br />This is by recollection but he spoke of simple tools designed to do a single thing well.   Now, a few months out from that I see the following on <a href="http://noisebetweenstations.com/personal/weblogs/?p=1855">Noise Between Stations</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>Robust tools are seductive, but their complexity quickly results in diminishing returns. Adopt tools with as many features as you need, and no more. Usually a few essential features will enable you to do many things well.</blockquote>Interesting and thought provoking.   One thing I'd add is to have tools that let you do things fast and terse.  What about a class designer for Visual Studio that let you design a class skeleton with as little as the following:<br /><br />class Person:<br />p string FirstName<br />p string LastName<br />p int ID<br />m DoSomething(int paramA, string paramB)<br />m DoSomethingElse(string[] p, ArrayList p2)<br />language C#<br /><br />would emit:<br /><br />public class Person{<br /> private string m_FirstName;<br /> private string m_LastName;<br /> private int m_ID;<br /> public string FirstName{<br />   get{<br />    return m_FirstName;<br />  }<br />   set{<br />    m_FirstName = value;<br />  }<br /> }<br />    // and so on<br />}<br /><br /><br />The challenge of something like that would be leveraging plain text without becoming too esoteric.  I would have assumed a lot of tools that would automate things like this but Visual Studio 2005's "class diagram" tool seems to disprove that.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
