If you, like me, are disappointed not finding them with SQL Server 2005, and you have Visual Studio 2005 installed, navigate to:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\SDK\v2.0\Samples\Setup\</span><br /><br />You'll find scripts to generate your old friends for another round of programming.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
