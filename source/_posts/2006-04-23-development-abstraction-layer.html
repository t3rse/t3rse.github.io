In his most recent essay, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/DevelopmentAbstraction.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Development Abstraction Layer</span></a>, he asserts that management at a software company should build an "abstraction layer" that eliminates all distractions from the programmers except programming. Programmers are to be cushioned in the best environment possible to think:<br /><br /><blockquote>A programmer is most productive with a quiet private office, a great computer, unlimited beverages, an ambient temperature between 68 and 72 degrees (F), no glare on the screen, a chair that's so comfortable you don't feel it, an administrator that...<br /></blockquote><br />Okay stop Joel!  That is the perfection that I dream of but have yet to really be placed into.  In a different thread, however, I get my answer as to why:<br /><br /><blockquote>But of course, it really depends on where you are in the foodchain. For Developers, I've always considered it to be:<br /><br />Bottom - Coroporate IT Department Developers. Developers are a cost center<br /><br />Middle - Internet Company. Developers are part of the core business strategy.<br /><br />Top - Shrinkwrap Vendors. Developers are the profit center.</blockquote>Generally speaking this seems to be true.  Because my experience has primarily to do with corporate environments, there is a vast difference between that programmer experience and that of, say, your average programmer at Google.<br /><br />My current employer is good to us, however - most of that seems to come from the fact that the principal is himself a programmer.  As a result we have excellent hardware, software, beverages, chairs, and reading material.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
