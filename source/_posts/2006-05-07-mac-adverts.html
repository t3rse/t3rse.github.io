<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />The <a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/">most recent Mac advertisements </a>have two guys, side by side: a chubby guy that looks like a dishevled Bill Gates and a young hipster.  You can guess who represents the PC and who represents the Mac. <br /><br />But truth is a little bit more boring than fiction: Macs are vulnerable too.  They are expensive too - I was salivating over a MacBook until I priced one out. <br /><br />Luckily I have an iBook courtesy of the company that I can use. I love it, but I don't have that kind of money - or rather, I'd drop it on a nice <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.lenovo.com/us/en/">Thinkpad</a> </span>or <a href="http://www.alienware.com"><span style="font-style: italic;">Alienware</span></a> and keep that extra money I had left over.<br /><br />I always liked Mac ads (Remember the "<a href="http://plex.us/videos/switch.html">switch</a>" campaign?).  Who else would get folks like De La Soul and Liza Richardson for an endorsement?<br /><br />But alas, here I sit in the coffeehouse: a monstrosity of a HP laptop in front of me, upon which I write code in javascript, perl, C#, VB.NET, and C++, running my RSS aggregator, messenger, and of course, of course Firefox amongst other things in the toolbox.  And I'm not in a bad suit either.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
