Here are 3 ways you can do it:<br /><br />1. Response.Redirect(Request.Path);<br /><br />In which the path to the request is presented in the following form: /MyApp/MyFile.aspx<br /><br />2. Response.Redirect(Request.RawUrl);<br /><br />In which not only is the path exposed, but also any querystring parameters like:<br />/MyApp/MyFile.aspx?foo=bar<br /><br />3. Response.Redirect(Request.Url.ToString());<br /><br />In which not only is the path and querystring parameters exposed, but made available as an absolute reference in the form:<br />http://MyServer/MyApp/MyFile.aspx?foo=bar<br /><br />Interestingly enough, if you have a named anchor in the form of &lt;a name=#test<a name="#test"></a>, this is not exposed by any of these methods!  (You'll see how I know a post or so from now, but suffices to say that you can still get this information from the client side by parsing the window.location object:<br /><br />alert(window.location);<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
