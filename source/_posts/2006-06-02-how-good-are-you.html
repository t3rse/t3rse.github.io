<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />In my teaching years I'd often run into people who thought they understood things that they really didn't.  Today, spreading like a fire I found a series of "do you know" posts that measured levels of understanding in three technologies most people think they understand: <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200605/levels_of_html_knowledge/">HTML</a>, <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2006/06/levels/">Javascript</a>, and <a href="http://friendlybit.com/css/levels-of-css-knowledge/">CSS</a>.<br /><br />Of course a personal evaluation leaves one open to questions but I think I'm doing okay level-wise. I wasn't at the top in any of the posts, but just a notch below.<br /><br />When it comes to technologies, even those that I use on a daily basis (like the above) I'm always loathe to say I have a maximum level of knowledge because I am well aware of those who sit on the top of the food chain in whatever areas of knowlege it might be: I'm no <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/">Eric Meyer</a> when it comes to CSS, I'm no <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/">Thomas Fuchs</a> when it comes to javascript, and although I know much of what there is to know about HTML, I haven't spent (what I consider to be a waste of) time navigating differences in rendering on different browsers and standards support unless it's been a big problem on a project.<br /><br />Well, here's to all of us who are still learning...<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
