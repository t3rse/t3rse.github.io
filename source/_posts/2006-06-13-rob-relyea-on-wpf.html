<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><p class="MsoNormal">The timelag on posts is due to several 4 hour nights in succession while partaking in the festivities at TechEd.<span style="">  </span>Here is a quick recap of Monday.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">First session was WPF presented by <a href="http://rrelyea.spaces.msn.com/PersonalSpace.aspx">Rob Reylea</a>.<span style="">  </span>WPF seems to be coming together more and more; Rob demonstrated new controls and old controls with new features: the listbox is quite a standout – textboxes that support spellchecking, controls having the ability to embed any other controls (button in a button).<span style="">  </span>Another new feature is in the ability to do screen layout: flow layout, grid layout, and others besides the traditional absolute layout most WinForms developers are used to.<span style="">  </span>Databinding in WPF is also quite improved, and learned from the web world: there is a repeater type approach to it now possible as well as functionality in the new listbox control. Vectors, fonts – there was a lot to the presentation.<span style="">  </span>Rob has a blog, so it’s something to watch as the WPF things consolidate more.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">After the session was finished I asked Rob whether they were watching other projects like Mozilla’s XUL/XPFE stuff since, in my own thinking, they were similar in approach.<span style="">  </span>He was a bit dismissive here in the sense that he didn’t see why WPF and XPFE should be compared.<span style="">  </span>Since we didn’t have the same assumptions, I withdrew the question although here is my own thinking: </p>  <ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="1" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal" style="">XAML      is like XUL, both are a special markup for describing presentation. </li><li class="MsoNormal" style="">XPCOM      provides hooks into the operating system functionality, making the client      thick just the way that Windows Vista is going to have a special      understanding and capability with XAML and the code associated with WPF      applications.<o:p><br /></o:p></li></ol>    <p class="MsoNormal">There are some big differences for sure: XPFE uses javascript and CSS, WPF does not.<span style="">  </span>XPFE relies on RDF, and I’m not sure that they’ll be any configuration involved in WPF applications since the runtime should handle much of that for the developer.<span style="">  </span>I am not sure about this.  Another set of differences are the vectors and rendering of WPF - XPFE does not, to my knowledge, have an equivalent.  However, the basis for my assumption was that they both attempt at solving similar problems - extend the web aware application to the desktop to give it a more "client app" functionality and feel.  Leverage better controls and have more flexibility than HTML/DHTML and so on.  And yes, this is from the perspective of WPF/e - the use in web based applications.<br /></p>    <p class="MsoNormal">There is much to learn, and much to be seen of WPF, I’ll stay tuned to Rob’s and other blogs that follow the development.</p>  <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
