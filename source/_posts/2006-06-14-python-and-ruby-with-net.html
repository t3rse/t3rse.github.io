Mahesh was covering the <a href="http://www.ironpython.com/">IronPython</a> efforts for .NET and John came to talk about Ruby.  It was refreshing to see the smaller number of developers practically using .NET but for whom language mattered.<br /><br />Mahesh gave a history of Python support in the CLR and made a case for dynamic languages within .NET.  His examples were pretty cool, especially when he started with a few examples of Python:<br /><br />2 + 2  (room is quiet)<br />22**64 (room is quiet - David is amazed at the response in milliseconds)<br /><br />He also showed a powerful implementation of a Matlab / Mathematica type tool written in Python for .NET. <br /><br />John's part of the talk was also very good - he has written a bridge between Ruby and the CLR.  John was fairly funny and expressive and his demos of Ruby and the CLR were fairly good in giving a picture of what he was tring to do.<br /><br />John's blog is <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/">here</a>, Mahesh doesn't blog but a search on Google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Mahesh+Prakriya&amp;btnG=Google+Search">shows him</a> in a few places.  I'm going to be downloading Iron Python and RubyCLR in the next month or so.  Not completely sure, but it seems that <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/articles/2006/03/16/third-drop-of-rubyclr">here</a> is where one can find RubyCLR.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
