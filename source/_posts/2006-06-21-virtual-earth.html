It was a tour of <a href="http://local.live.com/">Virtual Earth</a> and how to write applications using the javascript library they expose in the <a href="http://dev.live.com/virtualearth/sdk/">Virtual Earth SDK</a>.<br /><br />You can get an idea of what Virtual Earth looks like by going to the site: <a href="http://local.live.com/">http://local.live.com</a><br /><br />The SDK is also quite simple; it consists of referencing some javascript libraries and using a DIV to position the mapped content.  For example, to get the basics, just view source on <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/virtualearth/">this page</a>.<br /><br />The Virtual Earth API has the following features, per the presentation:<br /><br /><ul><li>User Navigation</li><li>Mapping Imagery</li><li>"Bird's Eye" views</li><li>Pushpins</li><li>Find Places/Addresses</li><li>Directions/Routing</li><li>Polylines</li><li>Collections of GeoRSS</li></ul><br />For each of these features there is an interactive SDK that generates example code so that you can follow along for your own application.  *Very cool*. <br /><br />I did have a few issues with timing and synchronous processing; in other words sometimes the wait time for processing one command seemed to cancel out a command that directly followed it.  In my case I was trying to do a search for "Sioux Falls, SD" and then follow it with a ZoomIn method like so:<br /><br />            map.FindLocation('Sioux Falls, SD');<br />            map.SetMapStyle(VEMapStyle.Hybrid);<br />            map.ZoomIn();<br /><br />I'll dig around a bit - my idea for a helpful little location solution is a map of Sioux Falls and all the coffee shops along with their attributes: how good the coffee is, whether WiFi is free, and the general atmosphere.<br /><br />I'm also planning to dink around with the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps API</a> to see how it stacks up.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
