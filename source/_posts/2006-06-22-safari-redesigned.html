<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />I'm a rabid <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com">Safari </a>user.  I think they built their whole business plan for me personally... okay, that might be a bit arrogant but at least I know I'm not alone in my rampant desire for technical books and my need to constantly keep an updated library for the problems/platforms at hand.<br /><br />Initial thoughts:<br /><br />1. They've done a great job segmenting the pages to load in pieces so browsing through books is much faster. There seems to be heave leverage of Ajax involved in that process.<br />2. Search is much, much better.  Autocomplete when you enter search terms, faster response time, and a slider control that lets you sort by popularity or by relevancy.  Very, very cool.<br />3. Expand / Contract left navigation (table of contents, search results)<br />4. Printing is better - instead a popup it's a link to a page with just content.  The javascript to automate printing is still there but it doesn't automatically close the browser window when complete which is nice.<br /><br />I'm sure there are other improvements but getting search and printing to work better for a site offering online books is key. <br /><br />Just put <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/ruby/"><em>Ruby in a Nutshell</em> </a>on my bookshelf, preparation for <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyclr/">RubyCLR</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
