Today was my first step to getting started, here were my steps.<br /><br />1. Played a bit with <a href="http://tryruby.hobix.com/">a free online Ruby interpreter</a>.<br />2. Got <a href="http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl">the single click installer</a> for my own machine.<br />3. Read a bit of <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">documentation</a>.<br />4. Then discovered <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/?_x=1">Komodo</a>, the IDE I originally bought for Perl stuff supports Ruby and has an interpreter.  Very, very cool.<br /><br />Next step: language fundamentals.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
