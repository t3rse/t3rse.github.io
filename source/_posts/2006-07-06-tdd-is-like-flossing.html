They've heard of the tools like <a href="http://www.nunit.org/index.php">NUnit</a>, but they just don't do it. Take it from a guy who got drilled for several hours recently because of cavities between the teeth: it's not worth it.<br /><br />On a serious note, I'm spending most of my time in my current project on bug fixing.  I know that leveraging unit tests and a tool like NUnit will not only make me more productive, but also trim the amount of time I spend like today fixing bugs (all day long).<br /><br />The big question is how to apply that to a web application.  Many of the examples given for tests in NUnit really lend themselves to libraries (DLLs) and not to Web Forms with postback cycles.<br /><br />I haven't had much time to dig into it, but pretty soon I'll have to roll up my sleeves and do a comparison of the new Visual Studio Team System test capabilities and NUnit.  The NUnit people <a href="http://nunit.com/blogs/?p=19">blogged</a> a comparison but I'd like to have a look for myself. My leanings would probably be toward NUnit for simplicity, less overhead, and availability, but I'll withhold judgement until I've had a chance to get dirty.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>

for web applications you should also check out selenium:<BR/><BR/>http://www.openqa.org/selenium/<BR/><BR/>We're going to start using it at work, I haven't played with it yet.<BR/><BR/>AJ</div>
