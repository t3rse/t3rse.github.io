<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />You can watch the entire keynote <a href="http://blog.scribestudio.com/articles/2006/07/03/martin-fowler-railsconf-2006-keynote-address">here</a>, many a good thought. Some interesting thoughts:<br /><br />1. Ruby on Rails, as an opinionated framework with limited focus is good.<br />2. Fast development cycles are good, better than <span style="font-style: italic;">Big Design Up Front</span>.<br />3. People think in the mistaken trade off of quick & dirty (VB, PHP) and "enterprise."  Just because something was done quickly doesn't mean it's dirty.<br />4. Keep programmers and customers in close quarters, combine with quick release cycles and allow for observation of how software is used.  (I love this idea, I learn *so* much when I watch people use the software I've written for them).<br />5. Disdain for libraries (and I read along with that unnecessary abstraction) with several jokes about java.util.Calendar<br />6. Ruby <span style="font-style: italic;">the language</span> is essential for Rails.<br />7. Postmodern Programming: embrace inconsistencies, cobbled together world and realize software is the same way giving the example of Unix. <br /><br />I found myself agreeing with Martin, blow for blow most of the time.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
