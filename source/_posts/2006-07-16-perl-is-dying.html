I'd remain anonymous too if I made the claim since people tend to get passionate when it comes to Perl.<br /><br />My personal reaction is this: I like Perl, and I'd love to use it more, but I've only experienced evidence that supports his arguments as I've been dinking around in Perl over the last few years.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Update</span>: Interestingly enough, the direct link is now dishing out 403 errors.  I doubt the perl community would actively censor anything so I'll assume it's a glitch with the url I used. But, as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keymaker_%28Matrix_character%29#The_Keymaker">Keymaker</a> says: "<a href="http://www.perlmonks.com/?node=perl+is+dying&go_button=Search">Always another way...</a>"<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
