I agree in the sense that it's small things you'd have never thought of that clinch software.  I disagree that this can be applied to all Mac software; I am just now coming back from a session with ProTools, powerful software to be sure, but filled with lots of hidden menus, features, and quirks.<br /><br />Nothing makes me happy like good software, especially in the moments when it's obvious that something I want to do has really had some thought applied to it.  Printing in gmail, for example. Multiple tabs in Firefox.  The ! shortcuts for searching in yahoo. iTunes burning an audio file that's too big across multiple CDs.  Oh, and the smart playlists on iTunes too.  I should make a list someday...<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
