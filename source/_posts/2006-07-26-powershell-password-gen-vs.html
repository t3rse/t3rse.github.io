<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />Scott Hanselman just <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DictionaryPasswordGeneratorInPowershell.aspx">posted</a> an example of a password generator in powershell.  Very cool, and reminding me of <a href="http://hobbitwerk.brinkster.net/pwd">Hobbitwerk:::pwd</a>.  His script, however, is 7 lines of clean code.<br /><br />Speaking of Hobbitwerk:::pwd, I'm surprised by how useful it's become not only for myself but for a lot of the people I showed it to.  It's nice when a guy who's used to writing Me-ware makes something that other people leverage too.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
