Yet people laugh at VB and say it’s a bad language, and they’ve been talking about OO languages for decades.<br /><br />And no, Visual Basic wasn’t a great language, but I think the easy DB interfaces in VB were fundmantally more important than object orientation is, for example.</blockquote>Peter Norvig, yes <a href="http://www.norvig.com/">that Peter Norvig</a> at Google thinks he needs to keep improving his Javascript. It always  annoys me when people think they know javascript - not that it's unknowable, but knowing how to do alerts and toggle DIV visibility is for kids.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> gives the answers I would expect from him, especially espousing "values" as standing between good and mediocre programmers. For a long time I've been wanting to blog about his talk at <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/">Carson Workshops</a> concerning "beautiful code."<br /><br />The whole round table interview is interesting.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
