Buzz is all around since the Y-Combinated <a href="http://www.kiko.com">Kiko</a> is <a href="http://kiko.infogami.com/blog/final">folding</a> and being auctioned off.  I was interested in what looked like a blog post retrospective of the whole thing until I realized it was just <a href="http://onstartups.com/Home/tabid/3339/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/800/Hindsight20LessonsFromAFailedWeb20Startup.aspx">someone speculating</a>, not the kids from Kiko writing about what happened.<br /><br />Truth be told even though web calendars are interesting software, I really don't use them.  I used Kiko a few times just to see how it worked and was impressed with what it seemed to take programmatically.  And that's how I judge the whole thing - as a technical achievement, not as a sales person's way of making a lot of money even though they may have hoped for that side effect.<br /><br />Now if I had $50,000 and a lot of motivation I'd get that source code and make a calendar component for .NET - the <a href="http://www.componentscience.net/Products/WebPlanner/tabid/61/Default.aspx">last one</a> I worked with was no fun at all. And of course I know nothing about being profitable; it would be an interesting project is all.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
