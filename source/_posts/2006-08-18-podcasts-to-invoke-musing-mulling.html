I started as a very regular listener on IT Conversations and have since drifted around looking for quality material.  IT Conversations started with a lot of good content but it seems as though of late its drifted into MBA type material which is a bit vague for me; I prefer good technical podcasts.<br /><br />Some places I've found myself consistently happy:<br />1. <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes</a> - great coverage of the .NET universe along with other technical topics such as Syndication, SCRUM, and the like.<br />2. <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">Software Engineering Radio</a> - I am working at restraining myself of cultural stereotypes but the SE Radio crew are very, very concise.  They have a much better depth of coverage than other technical podcasts<br />3. <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com">.NET Rocks</a> - good show with an excellent track record.  Sometimes just a touch too long, but I've always liked DNR.<br /><br />I've listened to a few podcasts from <a href="http://www.webdevradio.com/">WebDevRadio</a>.  Much of what I heard was good, and I like how it takes me out of the exclusively .NET universe a bit. <br /><br />From IT Conversations, my favorites up to this point included <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail82.html">Steve McConnel</a>, <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail207.html">Joel Spolsky</a>,  <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail94.html">Philip Greenspun</a>, <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail195.html">Will Wright</a>, and <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail188.html">Paul Graham</a>. <br /><br />Although Venture Voice isn't really that interesting to me, <a href="http://www.venturevoice.com/2005/10/vv_show_17_jason_fried_of_37si.html">Jason Freid</a> and <a href="http://www.venturevoice.com/2005/11/vv_show_20_joel_spolsky_of_fog.html">Joel Spolsky</a> have some good interviews there as well.<br /><br />In the "lost podcast" genre - David Heinemeier Hansson of 37 Signals had a great talk at Carson Workshops where he talks about the basic philosophy of Ruby on Rails. I don't see a link to it but if you find it, it's good. <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/">Simon Incutio</a> took some great <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/notes/2006/summit/hansson.txt">notes</a> that will give you a good idea of what was said.<br /><br />Well, there are a lot of podcasts out there; too many for me to get to.  These are most of the ones I keep going back to and finding gems. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.pseale.com/blog/">Peter Seale</a> has a much more comprehensive listing <a href="http://www.pseale.com/blog/GreatPodcastRoundupChampionshipEdition.aspx">here</a>. I'm looking forward to going through his list, it would be nice to make a website that kept a nice listing of such podcasts.  Not necessarily aggregated, but something maintained by a more trusted curator.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
