I chose Visual Studio just because it would be easier for team members to get to; I can't look over everyone's shoulder and force them to write tests but I can make it as easy as possible to encourage the behavior.<br /><br />Before doing so I did a search to try to see if there were major differences between NUnit and Visual Studio's testing - I don't remember anything notable but today, just my luck since we've gone full force in the Visual Studio direction, I find <a href="http://vaultofthoughts.net/TestMethodInTheAbstractClass.aspx">a post</a> complaining of lack of functionality in Visual Studio's test framework vs NUnit.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
