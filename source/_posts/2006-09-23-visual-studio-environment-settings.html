<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />First it was Scott <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CommentView.aspx?guid=038f7325-ba8e-46d1-a1ad-ecc186167de8">talking</a> about his Visual Studio environment and then it was Jeff <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000682.html">posting</a> some of his own settings and <a href="http://idehotornot.ning.com/">a website</a> to download customized VS.NET Environment settings.<br /><br />I'm usually a bit boring when it comes to things like this - I used to like the courier font at 10 or 8pt since I'm used to laptops with next to nothing in coding real estate.  Otherwise everything was default. <br /><br />But I've taken to Jeff's <a href="http://idehotornot.ning.com/index.php/index/show?id=2044686">ZenBurn</a> settings quite a bit.<br /><br />I hope the IDE Hot or Not site takes off; it would be interesting to see what some other people's settings look like.  Who knew Visual Studio could have a Toyota Scion style effect and bring out a person's personality?<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
