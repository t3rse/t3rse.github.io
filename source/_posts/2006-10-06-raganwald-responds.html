<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />I had <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2006/09/people-process.html">posted</a> about Yegge's Agile/agile <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html">essay</a>, trying to follow some of the interesting comments that ensued on the web.  I made the following comment about Raganwald's response:<br /><br /><blockquote>"Raganwald has the most interesting <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/09/wasabi-cannot-cure-rotten-fish.html">response</a><br />I've seen so far: that it all comes down to people over process and a good team<br />will succeed despite methodological strategy. "</blockquote><br /><br />He has since posted an elaboration in response on his blog - I was a little off in my reading:<br /><br /><blockquote>"No. I'm saying that a "good" methodology cannot save a bad team. That does not<br />mean that a good team can survive a bad methodology. There are <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2005/01/what-ive-learned-from-failure.html">four<br />critical parts</a> of a successful software project, and in my experience you<br />cannot succeed if any of them are missing. People are the first of those,<br />management the last. Methodology is a part of management in my view. In some<br />situations, strong management can impose an informal rather than a formal<br />methodology. But it would be stretching a point to claim that such situations<br />lacked process or had a bad process."</blockquote><br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
