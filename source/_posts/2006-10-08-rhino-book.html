<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I got David Flanagan's new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596101996?tag=davidflanagancom&camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0596101996&adid=1828J3VMQDZS4GF7QAZY&amp;">Javascript Reference</a> earlier this week.  My fourth edition is nice and worn, but it will be nice to have the updated perspective since so much has happened in internet time since the fourth edition was published. It's the third edition of the book that I've owned and while buying the same book more than once has a big psychological drawback, I'm especially looking forward to reading the sections on the XmlHttp (AJAX) side of javascript.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
