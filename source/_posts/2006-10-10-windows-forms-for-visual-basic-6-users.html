<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />My current project at work is a Windows Forms application.  Even though I've been programming .NET almost daily since it's introduction, just about all of what I've done is web based programming using ASP.NET. The non-web code I've written has been for the most part libraries (DLLs) to use in web apps. <br /><br />Most of what I know about thick clients comes from doing work in Visual Basic 6 so while I usually know where I'd like to go with something, I find myself hitting a wall with how to do it in VS 2005.<br /><br />An example of this would be this morning, trying to figure out whether the Locked property for controls is ported to .NET Windows Forms.  Unfortunately it's not - the Locked property you find has to do with resizing and moving, not making controls editable.<br /><br />Fortunately MSDN has <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/we128ese.aspx">a great resource</a> here for people making the transition that lets you see Visual Basic 6.0 and Windows Forms compared directly.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >} </span></div>
