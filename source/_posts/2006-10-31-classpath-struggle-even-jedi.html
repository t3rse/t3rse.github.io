Stupid freaking classpaths."</blockquote><br />I can remember sitting in my one room apartment above a garage in Whittier fighting with classpaths, trying to wrangle them into my understanding of Java. It is not schadenfreude that makes me post this, it's more the comfort of knowing that I'm not the only one to have struggled with them. <br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
