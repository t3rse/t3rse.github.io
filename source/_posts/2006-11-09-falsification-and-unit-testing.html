<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3366ff;">{</span><br /><br />Did I ever post that unit testing is hard? <br /><br />It's hard. I'd love to see it in action at other shops since we've got so much to learn.  But let's tally the score of the moment:<br /><br />It's about 10 minutes to midnight and I've been working my way through someone else's code. This code is a piece of a separate assembly that does validation of a whole bunch of business rules before a person can process a loan application.  Each rule is fairly simple, along the lines of "if a person is not older than 18, they must have a cosigner" but there happen to be a lot of rules.  I designed the rules to be in a separate assembly because the client changes these frequently, so it will be easy to update with a new DLL instead of reinstalling the application.<br /><br />Our application is modeled as an object with a series of other objects and lists attached.  An application has a borrower. A borrower has an employment history. And so it goes - which makes for a fluid, transactional save or validation by simply passing the application object around. <br /><br />But I'm looking at a lot of validation at this late hour and finding a systemic issue.  The person who wrote the code made an assumption with respect to Lists attached to objects that makes our validation code ineffectual.  Here's a sample:<br /><br />   25         if (targetApplication.Coborrowers.Count > 0 &&amp; targetApplication.Coborrowers[0].Citizenship == String.Empty)<br />   26         {<br />   27             result.IsValid = false;<br />   28             result.Message = "First Cosigner Citizenship is required for Approved Status.";<br />   29         }<br />   30     }<br />   31     return result;<br /><br />See the bug?  If there are no coborrowers the rule (citizenship must be set) is never evaluated.<br /><br />But even more so, here's the rub: I had the developer write unit tests for each and every validation rule they put out as a method.  I thought a night like tonight: midnight, fatigue, and a crapload of code to fix for a promised build, would be avoided as a result.<br /><br />The large picture here has to do with the way the unit test was designed to verify the functionality of the validation rule.  Because the problem was approached as gingerly, I think the unit tests weren't liable to find a more subtle bug like this.  Instead, the unit test probably attempted to validate a coborrower with a citizenship, asserting true, and a coborrower without citizenship, asserting false.  No thought was given as to whether a coborrower may not exist.<br /><br />Perhaps, in programming, we need to focus more on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">falsification</a> in our unit tests - attempts to break the code or find ways it will assert what's expected under the wrong conditions.  But that's all theory right now and I've got a decision to make: stay up late and try to keep my word or heading to bed and fixing the code under the right conditions... the purists will say that a rushed fix is bad, especially since I didn't write the first iteration and won't have time to update the unit tests (I know, I know: bad).  But I have to live in a world of realisms where the pain of a broken promise is greater than the pain of a rushed, patchworked fix. Time to get the Mt. Dew out of the fridge...<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3366ff;">}</span></div>
