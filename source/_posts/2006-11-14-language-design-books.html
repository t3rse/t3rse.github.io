<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />Joel Spolsky is so popular that I'm sure upon his <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01b.html">mention</a> of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools">Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools</a>" - the so called "Dragon Book" - interest and sales must have shifted a little. <br /><br />In this week's Software Development Times <a href="http://www.knowing.net">Larry O'Brien</a> clarifies with a few resources  including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Compiler-Design-D-Grune/dp/0471976970">Modern Compiler Design</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Pragmatics-Second-Michael/dp/0126339511/sr=1-1/qid=1163549254/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-8026439-9839264?ie=UTF8&s=books">Programming Language Pragmatics</a>.<br /><br />Because I'm not classically trained, I find myself with significant gaps in areas like this (compiler construction, algorithms, etc... ), so a reading list is a good thing to have. Of course, the list is the easy part and the finding of time to read and study is what is difficult.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
