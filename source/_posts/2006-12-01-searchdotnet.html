<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />Dan Appleman, best known to me for his exhaustive book <em>Dan Appleman's Visual Basic Programmer's Guide to the Wind32 API</em> has had a sputtering <a href="http://www.danappleman.com/">blog</a> over the last few years.<br /><br />But recently it caught my eye because Appleman has created <a href="http://www.searchdotnet.com/default.aspx">SearchDotNet</a> which is a customized Google search engine for .NET sites. <br /><br />It's nice to search for something like "Dictionary" or "Parallelism" and get relevant code despite the concept crossing language and platform barriers.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

Hi I would like to mention another search engine for dot net developers which cover all good sites for dot net and related technologies as of August, 2008.<BR/><BR/>http://tips.developersvoice.com/devsearch<BR/><BR/>This developers search engine is inspired by searchdotnet.com and I try my best achieve even batter results. Both these developers search engines would greatly help the developerâ€™s community.<BR/><BR/>DO test it yourself and let me know your comments.</div>
