<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />It's been around for a while but this <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix-win2000/invitedtalks/lucovsky.ppt">powerpoint</a> (linked directly as a *.ppt) is a presentation from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lucovsky">Marc Lucovsky</a> about the development process of the early iterations of Windows NT to Windows 2000.<br /><br />Interesting things:<br />+ NT 3.1 was ~3 years late (I'm not feeling so bad about being behind on my current project)<br />+ The original team was only 6 people from DEC. That's astonishing. The eventual development team size was 200 with 140 people on the test team.<br />+ Quotes:<br /><blockquote>"To scale a development team, you need to establish a culture"<br />"Sloppiness is not tolerated"<br /></blockquote><br />+ By Windows 2000, the development team was 1400. I wonder what Vista's team size is?<br />+ The evolution of source control and branching at Microsoft.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
