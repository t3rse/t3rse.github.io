<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br /><a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> had me in stitches with the following paragraph on his <a href="http://daringfireball.net/colophon/">colophon</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote><p>"If Daring Fireball looks like shit in your browser, you’re using a shitty<br />browser that doesn’t support web standards. Netscape 4 and Internet Explorer 5,<br />I’m looking in your direction. If you complain about this, I will laugh at you,<br />because I do not care. If, however, you are using a modern, standards-compliant<br />browser and have trouble viewing or reading Daring Fireball, please do let me<br />know. "<br /></p><br /></blockquote><p>His most recent essay, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/12/omnivapor">Omnivapor</a>, was referenced on Reddit but what got me going there was<br />his essay <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/location_field">The Location Field is the New Command Line</a> featured in Joel Spolsky's <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=453">Best Software Writing I</a>. </p><p><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span><br /></p></div>
