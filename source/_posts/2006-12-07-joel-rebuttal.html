<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />Usually what Joel says is treated like gold by many developers, myself included. In a <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/12/05.html">recent post</a> he berated Om Malik for <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/11/01/8392026/index.htm?postversion=2006111409">using a lego metaphor</a> in describing how easy it was for startups to create software while paying homage to Fred Brooks's essay <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~maratb/readings/NoSilverBullet.html">No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering</a>. Joel cleverly adds context to his comments by referencing a Business Week article from the early 1990s that uses the lego analogy with the idea of object oriented programming.<br /><br />I've listened to Om Malik's podcast and can tell he is no programmer - in fact, I kind of laughed at <a href="http://www.web20show.com/articles/category/podcast/page/7">a podcast</a> on instant messaging where he called file sharing in instant messaging clients unnecessary (something nearly everyone I know from a working angle uses on a daily basis).<br /><br />But what Om started was a good conversation which inspired Wesner Moise in <a href="http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/2006/12/lego_programmin.html">his rebuttal</a> to Joel asserting that Fred Brooks was as astute in his essay. Software development has advanced, Moise seems to be saying, well beyond what it was in the days of Brooks.<br /><br />The desert for this travelling conversation was <a href="http://abxy.org/a/The_evolution_of_game_programming_part_1/">this story</a> on programming Atari 2600 games. That sounds like tough work indeed.<br /><br />Well, I'm off to play with regular bullets and legos.<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">Update:</span> Some interesting <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2006/12/05/Parkinsons_Law_Eats_Silver_Bullets.aspx">comments</a> from Phil Haack on the subject.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
