<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />I'm quite fond of the different calendars with tutorials this season. From my first glances at this year's <a href="http://24ways.org/">24ways</a> I should learn as much as I did last year.  I also was delighted to discover the <a href="http://perladvent.pm.org/">perl advent calendar</a>.  Any other decent holiday calendar/tutorials?<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
