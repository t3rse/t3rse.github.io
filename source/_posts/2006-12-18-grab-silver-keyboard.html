<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />Steve Yegge's <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/12/i-take-it-all-back-send-me-your-money.html">last post</a> couldn't have come at a better time for me; I've been having a lingering feeling that I'm stuck in the mud, working too hard and having bad ideas.<br /><br /><blockquote style="PADDING-LEFT: 3px; BORDER-LEFT: orange 1px solid">So how do you make yourself a superstar? <strong>Never stop learning.</strong> I've heard<br />people say they think this position is a crock, that it's ludicrous, that you<br />couldn't possibly spend your whole career learning new things.<br /><br />But I think differently. I think every program you write should be the<br />hardest you've ever written. And that's what I blog about, mostly. Improving<br />yourself. Because most employers, the ones who matter in the long run, they'll<br />be able to see how great you've become, and they'll alter the very course of<br />their business plan, if necessary, to make the best use of you. Does that sound<br />incredible? Well, I've seen it play out both ways over my modest 20 years in our<br />industry, and that's how I see it.<br /></blockquote><br />I don't think it absolves me from having weak ideas or from lacking the most effecient approach to working outside of the office, but I know my direction is right. I need to work on my mechanics in future and make sure that while I strive to improve as a developer that I get better at picking what matters and solving problems that are this fine balance between learning something new and not being so challenging that they are unpractical.<br /><br />I've been disheartened as well by the lack of community. People I know about online - my mentor list - make my life that much better but it seems rare that I meet people outside of conferences and the online world who have more desire for themselves other than getting a job done. In those dark moments I ask myself why I try and wonder whether it even will matter in the end.<br /><br />But something in my intuition tells me I can't stop. That outside my "feelings" there are people like Steve who have walked a path I'm on. <br /><br />This year I did become a better programmer. My skills as a designer improved. I created a bunch of tools that were useful not only to me but to others. My vindication came perhaps a month ago when I looked at a screenshot of a code repository program I'd written and forgotten about two years ago. I had rewritten a code repository program this year with tag support and as I compared the functionality and design I realized that I'd grown like a tree; the effect was visible over the long term but not on a daily basis.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
