It's interesting to me how Apple is so good at generating a buzz and feeding the frenzy of their users. My boss is using Vista right now on a brand new shiny laptop but no one is gathering around the machine to say "ooh" - but I guarantee if I had an iPhone in the cub area people would be crawling over each other to have a look.<br /><br />To be sure a lot of it is design, but there seems to be something more.  Apple seems to court their users with the new and the novel, Microsoft rolls out a new version of what you already have (operating system) or a copy of something else that's successful (Zune).  Apple knows how to keep people guessing and drum up occasions like Macworld to wow people. Microsoft seems to release their products in a time warp (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/umpc/default.mspx">Origami</a>, anyone?) and make things that seem to have no mass appeal (Origami == <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton">Newton 1994</a>?).<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />I'm geeky enough, however, to be excited about Microsoft's products - specifically IIS 7.<br /><br />Well, the iPhone is out of my price range (I always take the <em>free with the service</em> phones) but it's good eye candy.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
