<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />I'm excited that next week I'll be in Los Angeles. I got the opportunity, along with some other people from Daktronics, to attend Developmentor training on Biztalk.  Tonight I was going to watch a Biztalk presentation from TechEd but got a little sidetracked watching <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford's</a> <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/2006/10/18/video-presentation-douglas-crockford-on-the-theory-of-the-dom/">excellent javascript presentation on the DOM</a>.<br /><br />Although the presentation is about the DOM which a lot of people think they know and understand, Crockford adds a lot of historical and insider information about how browsers work and what implications that has for writing DHTML. Really interesting.<br /><br />There's a <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/douglas-crockford-video-advanced-javascript">different presentation</a> I was looking for - on javscript's prototype based inheritance, but I'll get to that on a different day.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
