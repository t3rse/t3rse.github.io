<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />A good way to get attention in the programming blogs is to draw a distinction between "good" and "mediocre" programmers and allow developers to question whether they can consider themselves "good."<br /><br />Atwood <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000543.html">posts</a> that you're either good or mediocre at programming despite the amount of practice or effort you may decide to put in:<br /><br /><br /><blockquote>"A mediocre developer can program his or her heart out for four years, but that<br />won't magically transform them into a good developer. And the good developers<br />always seem to have a natural knack for the stuff from the very beginning."</blockquote>Joel Spolsky and a few others seem to use the tactic quite a bit; reeling people in by causing them to question themselves.<br /><br />I wonder what it is in a programmer's DNA that leaves them with a self doubt?  On the other end of the spectrum there are a lot of popular posts devoted to the topic of making oneself better - I found this old Steve Yegge <a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/practicing-programming">post</a> as a rebuttle to Atwood; that practice is not only a way to get better, but a necessity of the better programmers.<br /><br />I have no idea how to categorize myself; I don't dare think of myself as good especially when people like Joel Spolsky can throw <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/TestYourself.html">tests</a> my way that pretty much leave me gaping and grasping.<br /><br />But, although the blog post I bothered to take time to write speaks to the contrary, I'm not sure if questioning oneself is very productive.  Most programmers I respect out there are unbelievably productive - there doesn't seem to be a lot of time for being paralyzed by self doubt. <br /><br />Back to practice I go.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
