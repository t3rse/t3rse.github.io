<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading <a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/jessicalivingston.html">Jessica Livingstone's</a> book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141"><em>Founders At Work</em></a>, which consists of interviews with various techie entrepreneurs.  Joel Spolsky's interview, however, is <a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/joelspolsky.html">available</a> as a freebie and makes for some interesting reading.  I've been a Joel "fanboy" for a while but it still impresses me how each time he writes (or comments) at length there's so much truth from which to learn.<br /><br />There are several other interviews I'm looking forward to reading, particularly Philip Greenspun's on the making (and possibly breaking) of Ars Digita.  A few years ago Philip did <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail94.html">an interview</a> on IT Conversations that impressed a lot of "lessons learned" upon me. <br /><br />But back to Joel, the interview is insightful and there are many gleanings on consulting, founding, competition, learning, and making good software.<br /><br />I'll get to the <a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/stevewozniak.html">Woz interview</a> this weekend.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
