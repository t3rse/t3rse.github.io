<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />People I work with are always amused by my excessive use of "foo" in naming things while I do examples or sketch out ideas.  I was equally amused with <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=71">Hanselminutes 55</a> which I can roughly quote here:<br /><br /><blockquote>... so once you've got your <em>foo</em> class accepting a <em>bar</em> class<br />and more likely it's going to be accepting a <em>IBar</em> interface... <em>foo</em> depends on <em>bar</em> which depends on <em>blah</em> and <em>yada</em> ... your instantiation looks like new <em>foo</em>, new <em>bar</em> which takes new <em>yada</em>... </blockquote><br /><br />Fun stuff, but the real conversation was about <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html">Monorail</a>, a piece of the <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/">Castle Project</a>, a .NET web application framework I've been interested to look at for some time.  The most interesting argument for the use of Monorail/Castle was the ability to have greater and more precise test coverage than with a typical ASP.NET application using <a href="http://wtr.rubyforge.org/">Watir</a> or an equivalent technology. All the buzz about being Test Driven usually breaks down for me when I'm looking at the kind of web applications we build.  Even something like Watir is a frightening prospect on an ASP.NET page with several grids, in a masterpage, loaded with javascript - and has about 10 different "directions" that a tester could take.  Extend that to about 100 pages, many of which support different "views," and you've got, well, a bit of a problem in being "Test Driven."<br /><br />The conversants, besides Scott were <a href="http://www.netbrick.net/blog/">Aaron Jensen</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jlewalle/">Jacob Lewallen</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
