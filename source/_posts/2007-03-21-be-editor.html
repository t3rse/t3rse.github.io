It makes me think of two occasions: first, when I guffawed at James Gosling saying that his favorite IDE was Emacs, and then later on when I was teaching a .NET development class at <a href="http://my.countrywide.com/">Countrywide</a> and a person sitting the class (graduate of <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/">UPenn</a>) sneered at using Visual Studio .NET and instead opted for <a href="http://www.textpad.com/">Textpad</a> (he hadn't used it before but still leaned towards a simple text editor and his ability with the command line). Needless to say he put everyone to shame.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
