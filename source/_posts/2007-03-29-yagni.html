<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/">Tim</a> posted about trying to explain <em>Yagni</em> on Twitter and after <a href="http://c2.com/xp/YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">looking it up</a> I realized it's something I've tended towards without having a vocabulary for it - you know that sense when something is so familiar that you think there's got to be a technical term for it.<br /><br />And a person need not be an "Extreme Programming" proponent to see the truth; I have a Yagni moment almost each day when a person asks a question about how to do something and I'm more bothered with the question (why on earth would you do that???!!)  than coming up with a solution.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
