They are offering <a href="https://www.red-gate.com/Dynamic/Downloads/DownloadForm.aspx?download=ebook2">two incredibly dense PDFs </a>with the best stuff from the SQL Server Central website for FREE. If you use SQL Server in any form, it's a great value for nothing.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.red-gate.com/">red-gate</a> makes excellent tools as well - we use <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/SQL_Compare/index.htm">SqlCompare</a> to synchronize development and test databases regularly.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
