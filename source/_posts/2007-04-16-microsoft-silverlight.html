It's ironic that a matter of days after Paul Graham declared Microsoft "<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html">dead like IBM</a>" that something like this should be announced.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how this fits into web development with Adobe's <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/apollo/">Apollo</a>. Adobe has played a masterful first hand by making Apollo open source. It will be interesting to see how Microsoft responds.<br /><br />The good news is there is a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c744cbb8-d4d9-4bf9-ad5c-eef36e064911&displaylang=en">CTP</a> for download, so for those of us who won't get to Mix, there is room to dig around.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
