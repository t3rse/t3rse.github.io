<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br /><em><a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/">Dreaming in Code</a></em> author, Scott Rosenberg is interviewd on IT Conversations <a href="http://osc.gigavox.com/shows/detail1707.html">here</a>. You can impress your friends that you "read" his book even if you've only heard a few ideas. A recurring theme is just how hard it is to write software - a good reminder for me since I have frequent bouts of self doubt that is unwarranted.  It's not just hard for me, it's hard for everyone.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
