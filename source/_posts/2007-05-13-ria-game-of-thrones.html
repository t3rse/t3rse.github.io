<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />Catching up on my aggregator yesterday I saw that Dare had <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=36010cd1-ba00-4531-946c-da041d934e9e">posted</a> about Sun's response to Silverlight: their own rich internet application (RIA) framework to supplant (though the politically correct answer is not that it would, it's just a "new opportunity") some of the Web 2.0/AJAXish things that have been popular of late.  Mary Joe Foley presents a noncommittal <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=426">analysis</a> and <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/05/09/JavaFX-Script">Sam Ruby</a> points to a few resources.<br /><br />I went to <a href="https://openjfx.dev.java.net/">Sun's page</a> and although it seems like a real enough project the fact that it's applet based right now (and far slower than the Silverlight <span style="font-style: italic;">beta</span> in installing) seems to point to it as an unfinished thought.  Their <a href="https://openjfx.dev.java.net/#demos">demos</a> at this point are not just slow, but rather underwhelming - compare that with the MLB demo at Silverlight and it's quite a contrast.<br /><br />But I'm willing to assume that Sun is serious and that their technology has a lot of appeal, especially to many people who live on the "Not Microsoft" koolaid.  If that's the case there is a three way battle going on between Adobe, Sun, and Microsoft for how RIAs will be developed. <br /><br />I wonder if it's wise in a situation like this to hope for a clear winner; competition should hopefully produce the best technology out of each company.  Although there will doubtless be compatibility questions that come up, but because each seems to be plugin/runtime based, it seems like developers will have an opportunity to choose a target and build with/for it rather than some of the monkeying around that needs to be done to make a web application work on multiple browsers. <br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
