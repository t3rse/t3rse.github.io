I <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2007/01/crockford-javascript-presentation.html">posted before</a> on some of his excellent javascript tutorials, this is on par with them. While he's done a good job of granting some ideas in making software quality better, my train of thought goes towards my own workplace and how we can make information like that actionable. <br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
