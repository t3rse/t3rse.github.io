<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />This <a href="http://www.doolwind.com/index.php?page=11">programming personality test</a> was interesting. <br /><br />Your programmer personality type is:   PLSC<br /><br /><blockquote>You're a Planner.You may be slow, but you'll usually find the best<br />solution. If something's worth doing, it's worth doing right.<br /><br />You like coding at a Low level.You're from the old school of programming<br />and believe that you should have an intimate relationship with the computer.<br /><br />You don't mind juggling registers around and spending hours getting a 5%<br />performance increase in an algorithm.<br /><br />You work best in a Solo situation.The best way to program is by yourself.<br />There's no communication problems, you know every part of the code allowing you<br />to write the best programs possible.<br /><br />You are a Conservative programmer.The less code you write, the less chance<br />there is of it containing a bug. You write short and to the point code that gets<br />the job done efficiently.<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>
