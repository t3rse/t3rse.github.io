A few years later, I spent time in my <a href="http://www.rosslynacademy.com/">high school</a> computer classes using Apple IIe computers - for the most part it was typing but I had moments of the extracurricular. <br /><br />My freshman year of <a href="http://www.biola.edu/">college</a> (1993), after many months hovering around the computer store, drooling and daydreaming, a family gifted my sister and I with a Powerbook 160.  The little Powerbook that could took us through the college years although by the end it was on its last legs -<br /><br />... after which I took a long departure from the Apple universe. I began working with PCs and forgot how much fun it was to pick icons, leverage a trackball, and use the Finder. <br /><br />After talking my boss into it, however, a year ago I got the priviledge of using Macs again with a company owned, David leveraged iBook G4.  It's still a foreign environment but it's nice to return to - especially last week after my HP laptop needed to be reinstalled after catching a virus.<br /><br />All this to post that there is <a href="http://tofslie.com/work/apple_evolution.jpg">this interesting graphic</a> of Macs in time, with most of my old friends along the way.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

Agreed, "privilege" is an appropriate word.  After a stretch of 20 years (since my stepsister had one) I've been poring through my own Mac for a couple years now.  It's renewed my faith in the ability of man to guide a machine, and not vice versa.</div>
