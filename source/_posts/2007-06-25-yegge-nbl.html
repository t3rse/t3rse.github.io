Having just finished   Yegge's most recent post <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rich-programmer-food.html">Rich Programmer Food</a> this weekend, and following his <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/02/next-big-language.html">NBL (Next Big Language) post</a> from a while back, the dots seem to be connected.  It seems early even among technical blogs but I suspect information will start to seep out in the short future.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
