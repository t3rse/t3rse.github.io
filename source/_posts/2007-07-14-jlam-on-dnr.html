A few days ago I listened to <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=254">John Lam on Dot Net Rocks</a>.  I'll admit that sometimes the DNR people can be annoying to me (think Richard Campbell saying over and over like it's a joke "Managed JavaScript??") but it was all worth it to hear some of the internal goings on with the Iron Ruby project.<br /><br />Gleaning: Iron Ruby is a ways off.  I got somewhat impatient and have been using IronPython in the meantime, but more on that later.  That's not a small decision for me because I am of <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">the Norvig perspective</a> on learning a new language - it takes the length of time needed to think in terms of the idioms of that language, as opposed to just writing your code with different syntax and keywords (ala writing C# in Ruby).<br /><br />Gleaning: Ruby is a powerful language for creating domain specific languages.  That meme has been floating in my head for a while - listened to a good <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/index.php?post_id=195834">Software Engineering Radio podcast</a> on the topic sometime back.<br /><br />Gleaning: JLam talks a bit about how the learning curve for new languages these days revolves around the frameworks for languages - I think the idea of Ruby combined with .NET is that the .NET libraries will fill a gap that Ruby has always missed in library support.  Dangerous or brilliant?  In other words, I'm sure the open source crowd (is/will be) up in arms because this will, in their minds, dilute the community effort behind a language.  Brilliant because the Mort you know (who is probably your boss) will have a better level of confidence about using it.<br /><br />Gleaning: Iron Ruby is implemented in C# but Managed Javascript for Silverlight is a VB.NET implementation!<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>
