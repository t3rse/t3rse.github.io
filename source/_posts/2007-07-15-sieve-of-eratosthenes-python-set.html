<span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">{</span><br /><br />I pretty much broke down after TechEd.  I thought I'd be patient enough to wait for Ruby but because Python is most mature I have started to learn it, whitespaces or no.<br /><br />The first thing I did was check out Guido van Rossum's tutorial for programmers, which was an excellent first step.  I've followed that up with some random programming - a lot of fun so far.<br /><br />I was wondering about the set operations in python and how that made a difference in programming since there aren't syntactical equivalents in .NET.  Incidentally at the time I was reading The Man Who Loved Only Numbers and ran across a short description of the Sieve of Eratosthenes as a way of finding primes.  I thought it would be a good way to check out the set operations of Python.<br /><br />I wrote the following:<br /><br /><pre style="font-family:courier;font-size:8pt;color: #eee;background: #000; margin: 1em 0; padding: 10px;overflow: auto; width:425px;"><br />from System import *<br /><br />def multiples(num, thresh):<br /> multi = []<br /> for i in range(2,thresh):<br />  m = num * i<br />  if(m < thresh):<br />   multi.append(m)<br />  else:<br />   break<br /> return multi<br /><br />primeThresh = 5000<br />print DateTime.Now.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss")<br />nums = range(2,primeThresh)<br /><br />for n in nums:<br /> nums = set(nums) - set(multiples(n, primeThresh))<br /><br />print nums<br /><br />print DateTime.Now.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss")<br /></pre><br /><br />Interesting, but slow.  The way I may do something like that in C# (which also works just fine in Python) would be this, which I wrote later:<br /><br /><pre style="font-family:courier;font-size:8pt;color: #eee;background: #000; margin: 1em 0; padding: 10px;overflow: auto; width:425px;"><br />from System import *<br /><br />primeThresh = 5000<br />print DateTime.Now.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss")<br />nums = range(2,primeThresh)<br /><br />for n in nums:<br /> for m in range(2,primeThresh):<br />  try:<br />   mult = n * m<br />   if(mult > primeThresh):<br />    break<br />   nums.remove(mult)<br />  except:<br />   pass<br /><br />print nums<br /><br />print DateTime.Now.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss")<br /></pre><br /><br />It's a lot faster than the previous approach which makes sense - doing set algebra on large sets should take a long time... but that begs the question: are those set operations dangerous (ie. so slow as to be costly).<br /><br />I'm wondering what's "pythonic" and how a jedi would write this most effeciently.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;color:#3333ff;">}</span></div>

I also found The Man Who Loved Only Numbers a fun read. Since you're interested in the sieve, site www.primestructure.com has an extensive discussion re. adding structure to it.<BR/><BR/>Marc</div>
