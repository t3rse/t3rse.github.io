<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >{</span><br /><br />I was looking over Justice Gray's post on <a href="http://graysmatter.codivation.com/HowIAmBecomingABetterDeveloperPart1OfInfinity.aspx">becoming a better developer in 6 months</a> and noticed that he had listed Freidl's <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regex/">Mastering Regular Expressions</a> as a one week reading project.  I'll preface my comments by admitting I am not the quickest read - unless I'm reading something I don't particularly care about I tend to go it slow no matter what the subject matter.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />Not really thinking of connecting the dots I checked in on Jeff Freidl's blog and digging around saw <a href="http://regex.info/blog/jfriedl-links/about/">it took him 2.5 years</a> to complete the first edition of the book.<br /><br />It strikes me as funny that there would be such a disparity in creation and consumption.  Of course I may be slow - a big part of my wanting to learn Perl was the desire to have the capacity to "think" in regular expressions - but over the last few years as I've gotten better and better I find it hard to think I could compensate the little projects and tools I've written without the pain and grit of using what I read slowly.<br /><br />But then again we can all rest assured that <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">there's no rush</a>.<br /><br /><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);font-size:180%;" >}</span></div>

I tend to be a little blessed with fast reading.  That being said, I wish I was blessed with faster writing as my list of books sorely needs updating with reviews!!<BR/><BR/>Thanks for reading!</div>
