<h1>{</h1> <p><a href="http://www.nregex.com" atomicselection="true"><img src="http://www.nregex.com/nregex/images/nregex.gif"></a> </p> <p>I embarrassed myself today (yelling at the work desk, telling everyone I'd take them to McDonalds)&nbsp;but with good cause: <a href="http://www.nregex.com/nregex/default.aspx">a tool</a> I wrote some time back made it to Scott Hanselman's <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmans2007UltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolListForWindows.aspx">2007 Ultimate Developer/Power User Tools List</a>. The goal of the tool was simple: to do browser based&nbsp;evaluation of regular expressions using the .NET engine.&nbsp; Prior to writing it I would frequent <a href="http://www.rexv.org/">Rexv.org</a> but because the engines supported there were different, I'd usually have to do some conversion to get things to the .NET world. </p> <p>There are quite a few .NET Regular Expression tools: <a href="http://www.ultrapico.com/Expresso.htm">Expresso</a>, which is my first and favorite since I've used it longest, but also tools like Roy Osherove's <a href="http://tools.osherove.com/CoolTools/TheRegulator/tabid/185/Default.aspx">The Regulator</a>. The problem with these tools, however, was that as fat clients I wasn't always easily able to use them: I work on different machines (home, work, client sites) and also assist people quite a bit away from my desk.</p> <p>There are also quite a few Regular Expression tools for the web, Rexv, which I mentioned before but also RegexPal. But these tools support either javascript or alternate implementations so patterns like (?&lt;foo&gt;\w+) usually return some kind of error.&nbsp; </p> <p>The way <a href="http://www.nregex.com">Nregex</a> works is pretty straight forward: I'm using <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a> for the Ajax library and working with the .NET implementation of the regular expression on the server.&nbsp; A simultaneous goal of mine is to get into more of YUI because I'm always building little knick-knacks in javascript and I think it's the library to beat right now.</p> <p>Of course it's a fledgling: I worked on it a few nights when I could and fixed bugs here are there when I had a moment.&nbsp; Please use it and give me <a href="http://www.nregex.com/nregex/Feedback.aspx">feedback</a> since that will be my biggest help in making it better.</p> <p>One more thing: I'm trying to collect useful regular expressions. I'd like to build a good library of expressions to help users of the tool. Use the <a href="http://www.nregex.com/nregex/Feedback.aspx">feedback form</a> and let me know if you've got one you've found handy. Don't worry if it's not .NET specific, I'll do the translation.</p> <h1>}</h1></div>
