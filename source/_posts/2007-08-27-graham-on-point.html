<h1>{</h1> <p>I was just missing the old Paul Graham, the one who would write wisdom for the type of programmer that I imagined myself to be. The most recent essay, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/head.html">Holding A Program In One's Head</a>, is that treat I've been waiting for.</p> <h1>}</h1></div>

Sorry, I meant #4 not #5.  "Test Often" could be along the lines of "Keep rewriting..."</div>

I would also add "Test Often".  If perhaps you  consider that's the same as #5... then I would still add "Test Real-Life Examples, not hypothetical use cases".  To follow his line of thinking, the more actual cases you run the more those become a part of the whole package/scene running in your head.</div>
