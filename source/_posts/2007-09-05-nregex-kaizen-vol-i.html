<h1>{</h1> <p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/kaizen/practice-your-personal-kaizen-207029.php">Kaizen</a> is all about small improvements that never stop coming.&nbsp; With respect to Nregex, I plan to keep it moving as a project by spending small amounts of time on new features that will hopefully make it more useful. </p> <p>Tonight's new feature, though it was really something I did on Saturday morning, is a bookmarklet that should make it a little easier to get into the site from elsewhere (like your favorite IDE).</p> <p>A few weeks ago my boss noticed some latency issues, especially with larger documents. I've added a "manual" mode that will let you press a button or just hit your enter key to evaluate a regex, rather than it being processed as you type.&nbsp; Animated gifs give a little feedback on wait time.</p> <p>If you have a request for a feature, please <a href="http://www.nregex.com/nregex/Feedback.aspx">submit it here</a>.&nbsp; If you have a handy regex you solved some problems with, please <a href="http://www.nregex.com/nregex/Feedback.aspx">submit it too</a>. I'm currently at work on a "library" that I hope to cover some basic regular expressions (phone, zip, ssn, and so on) with.</p> <h1>}</h1></div>
