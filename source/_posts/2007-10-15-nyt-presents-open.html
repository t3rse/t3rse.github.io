<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>A new boast puts perspective on the original New York Times tagline: "All the News That's Fit to Print."&nbsp; </p> <p>Now we have "All the Code That's Fit to printf()".</p> <p>On a serious note, <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/">OPEN is a new blog</a> written by and for developers. I'll subscribe for the moment even if all the code I'm interested in is usually in a language that doesn't support printf natively.</p> <p>Courtesy of <a href="http://www.cephas.net/blog">Aaron</a>.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1></div>
