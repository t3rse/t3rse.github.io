<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>LifeHacker has <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/screenshot-tour/first-look-at-firefox-30-319968.php">a first look</a> at the forthcoming Firefox 3. It's interesting to see lots of improvements to the storage and management of places visited online - I'm sure this will provide inspiration for the Internet Explorer team at Microsoft to implement cool new features too.</p> <p>A feature I asked for (and got a skeptical response) was the ability to do what Firefox seems to aim for but in a Google-ish way. That is to say that it would be nice to have a browser history management/search capability that precluded real effort in organization. In simpler terms, the whole "search, don't sort" experience one has with Gmail, except with browsing history and favorites.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1></div>
