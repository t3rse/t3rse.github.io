<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>On a whim I've signed up to be at CodeMash 2008.&nbsp; After learning about the conference when Hanselman posted he'd keynote, I mapped out that Sandusky, OH (Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot!) is none too far (an audio book's worth of distance). </p> <p>I'm really looking forward to the opportunity to walk among <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001004.html">Elvis and Einstein</a>, hopefully gleaning some direction along the way. The <a href="http://www.codemash.org/SessionList.aspx">session list</a> is impressive, I'm thinking it will be hard to choose a particular direction. </p> <p>I've been studying Python of late, so I'm really looking forward to <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=beckel">Bruce Eckel's</a> <em>Why I Love Python</em>. Another interestingly titled Python presentation <em>Crash, Smash, Kaboom Course in Python</em> will be run by MIT alum <a href="http://catherinedevlin.blogspot.com/">Catherine Devlin</a>.&nbsp; Finally on the Python front, I'll try to squeeze into the Getting Started with Django session. </p> <p>On the "indy" .NET programming, I'm interested in the <em>Introducing Castle</em> session from <a href="http://jrwren.wrenfam.com/blog/">Jay R. Wren</a>. Because Hanselman is going to be there I can't imagine no mention of ASP.NET MVC stuff, so hopefully it will somehow be mentioned at least comparatively.</p> <p><a href="http://silverlight.net/blogs/jesseliberty/">Jesse Liberty</a> is going to present on Silverlight, so that's something I won't miss either. There are other Microsoft technology presentations I should see but it would be hard to sit in on a Sharepoint session when I could be learning Python design patterns.</p> <p>The other area of interest I'll have is the Dojo stuff, two sessions in particular: Overview of the Dojo JavaScript Toolkit and Working Offline with Dojo+Google Gears, both by <a href="http://www.blueskyonmars.com/">Kevin Dangoor</a>.</p> <p>Well, it should be interesting from start to finish, I'll be working on my note taking skills so that I can share what I do learn.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="http://www.codemash.org/"><img alt="CodeMash &ndash; I&amp;apos;ll be there!" src="http://www.codemash.org/images/bloggerbadge2008.gif"></a></p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
