<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>In the wake of all the plastic surgery and body augmentation going on around, a developer like myself can feel a little out of place - out of century to be more exact.&nbsp; </p> <p>And yet, whether he's joking or not, I'm half tempted by Wesner's <a href="http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/2008/01/performance-enh.html">admission</a> to "performance enhancers." </p> <p>But the thing I know with certainty is that being productive will only beget the desire to be more productive. Instead of learning and implementing 4 technologies, it will be 8.&nbsp; I'll pile more home projects and "meware" until I'm aching for another 5 or 6 hours a day.</p> <p>In a world that has the audacity to produce ridiculously smart people who are subject to <a href="http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/2004/09/if_i_were_smart.html">feeling</a> that yet others are "smarter" I may as well hold.</p> <p>But it's tempting... maybe until I know F# and then I'll hold... </p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

"Just one more language... one more and then I'll be fine..."<BR/><BR/>I've been thinking about this the last couple weeks.  (1) I'm in danger of letting work take over my life.  (2). OTOH, isn't it great to have a job that so fun that you kind of *want* it to take over your life?</div>

I drink a good amount of coffee at work but not nearly as much as I used to. I assume that would be considered the default performance enhancer for many programmers. I also find that if I stay up late I get a nice boost of energy around 10pm, midnight and 2am. I personally think finding your own personal biorhythm and combining with a small amount of coffee if you need to boost your lows is the best policy to sustained productivity and a healthy body and brain.</div>
