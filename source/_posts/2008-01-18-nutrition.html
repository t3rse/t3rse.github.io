<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>I just looked at Oliver Steele's <a href="http://osteele.com/archives/2008/01/programmers-pyramid">programmer's food pyramid</a> and did a self evaluation of sorts. I know that I err too much on the reading of "blogs" versus reading long prose about programming.&nbsp; That's something to change this year.</p> <p>As well I use libraries a lot without digging into anything once my problem solving is done.&nbsp; I think there's a form of mental stamina in digging deeper into a problem once you've apparently solved it - my instinct is to simply move on and try to tackle what's next.&nbsp; Now that the .NET Framework code is <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/01/16/net-framework-library-source-code-now-available.aspx">available</a>, that and <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/">other</a> <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">libraries</a> should occupy my reading time.</p> <p>While I don't struggle with the inclination to write code, I've long since thought it's better to try to write different types of applications and build some breadth.&nbsp; Especially after my umpteenth web based CRUD app, I'm now interested in blending Windows Forms and Web stuff in the small variety of utilities that I compulsively write.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
