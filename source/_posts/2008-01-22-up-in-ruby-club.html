<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>A while back I had a phone call from a woman with an eastern European accent wondering if I would be willing to take a survey.&nbsp; I'm usually an instant no to queries like this but she knew my Achilles heel: <br><br>"Participants get $50 Amazon Gift Certificate"</p> <p>So a few days ago my inbox chimed with an email with the gift certificate in tow. I didn't hesitate with my purchase of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596516177?tag=davidflanagancom&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0596516177&amp;adid=1B3W8X81CQ0JC1RK934N&amp;">David Flanagan's Ruby book</a>.&nbsp; </p> <p>As an aside, it seems that Flanagan got some <a href="http://www.davidflanagan.com/blog/2008_01.html#000149">flack</a> from a Gilles Bowkett on not being a bona fide Ruby person. If Flanagan isn't <em>cultured enough</em> to do Ruby, I'm in trouble... </p> <p>... but I've been in trouble most of my short puff anyway.</p> <p>On a serious note: the "up in the club" attitude of some (okay, mostly Rails) Ruby people is what is driving a <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming/info/666i4/comments/">backlash</a> against Rails and Ruby in general.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

Also, there's just one L. Giles, not Gilles. "Jy-ulz", not "Jeel." Giles is British, Gilles would be French.</div>

On the one hand, David F. sent me a really angry e-mail which, and this is unusual for angry e-mails, was full of logical argument, and which really delivered more fairness than my anti-Flanagan screed had earned. So I have to give him full credit. I felt like I'd been a total dick.<BR/><BR/>On the other hand, there is a kind of locusts effect going on in the Ruby/Rails community. As long as I can buy groceries and such, I'm totally willing to risk a backlash, because I think the forward-lash was really overkill. Ruby doesn't need to be such a big deal. It's not supposed to be the next big thing. It's supposed to be an enjoyable language to code in.<BR/><BR/>People who only notice a community once it becomes a profitable market, and who come to a community looking for ways to exploit it, are going to create remarkably different books from people who love a community and became part of it long ago when no money was at stake.<BR/><BR/>Since I discovered Ruby via Rails, I came in with the first wave of locusts, but I have to say the old-schoolers who do it because it makes them happy appeal to me very much more than someone who's written a bunch of stuff for a dominant publisher based at least partly on what the market seems to want at any particular time.<BR/><BR/>I would very emphatically recommend picking up Hal Fulton's book before even giving Flanagan's a chance at all.<BR/><BR/>It's true there's snobbery in the Rails world and it's true that for the most part it's nothing to be proud of. If it's any consolation, I antagonized David Hansson, who created Rails and is therefore the absolute definition of Rails "cool," at least as badly as I antagonized Flanagan. Don't go misjudging an entire community just because I have this incredible way of pissing people off. I'm kind of thinking that that's just me.</div>
