<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>Ravi Mohan makes the provocative, if not new <a href="http://ravimohan.blogspot.com/2008/01/ratcatchers-and-engineers.html">claim</a> (with <a href="http://ravimohan.blogspot.com/2008/01/so-whats-wrong-if-you-arent-engineer.html">follow up</a>) that programmers are not engineers. I take the majority of his quibble to be the title some flaunt: "software engineer."</p> <p>I've never felt able to use "engineer" for myself, but I don't perceive this badly. My official title is "software architect" though most of my day is not spent on architecture.</p> <p>It's a bit postmodern of me but<strong><em> does anyone's title mean much?</em></strong>&nbsp; Short of very specialized work, one must have multiple skillsets for the different roles they are cast in on a daily basis. </p> <p>I have to do the following, fairly regularly:<br>1. Write Code<br>2. Write Specs<br>3. Customer Service<br>4. Testing<br>5. Write Proposals<br>6. Mentor<br>7. Marketing</p> <p>I'm owning up to a lot of stuff, particulary #7, that I would never admit to for the sake of saying that most jobs these days require multiple intelligences.</p> <p>Think <a href="http://www.calatrava.com/main.htm">Santiago Calatrava</a>: engineer, architect, artist. And he deals with clients, too.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
