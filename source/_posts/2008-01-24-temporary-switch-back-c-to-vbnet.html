<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>I did the switch back for a project that a VBA enlightened client requested but I kept finding myself asking how to syntactically do what I usually do in C# (especially inheritance-wise) in VB.NET.&nbsp; Terry Smith has a handy <a href="http://www.terrysmith.net/software/dotnet_ebook/index.html">online book</a> that has a comparison so that you can easily figure out what the VB.NET syntax is for what you know how to do in C#. I'm not sure when it was written; no word on Generics but that's an easy enough syntax to duplicate with (Of T) rather than angle brackets.&nbsp; What throws me off in addition to the inheritance verbosity are a lot of the array related casting operations that seem intuitive now in C# like:</p> <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">Dim dropRows As Row() = e.Data.GetData(GetType(Row()))</font></p> <p>Of course with the latest developments in VB.NET, I may end up using the language enough to make all of this easy to recall from memory.&nbsp; </p> <p>As much as I want to join the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CategoryView.aspx?category=VB">Red Sox fans</a> in cheering for VB, there are still many things that annoy me about the language.&nbsp; Line continuation characters are at the top of the list, and case insensitivity closely following. Yes, I strongly dislike case insensitivity in a programming language.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

Hey David,<BR/><BR/>Thanks for the link to my eBook! <BR/><BR/>It's getting a bit dated now I admit. I haven't updated it since .NET 1.1. <BR/><BR/>I'm glad some folks are still finding it useful though!<BR/><BR/>Terry</div>
