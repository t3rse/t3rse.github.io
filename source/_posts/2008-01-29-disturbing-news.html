<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <blockquote> <p>"I am going to tell you something that will disturb you. You might laugh, but it will be a cold uncertain laugh that will haunt you as you read on, because somewhere deep down you'll know it to be true. You might brush it off, get on with your day, yet sometime later, a week or a year, it will seep back in and unsettle you to the core. From that moment on you will be changed. You will think different, act different and will fundamentally be different. So take a moment to prepare yourself now, breath deeply, clear your mind and open up to the possibility that <strong>building software is hard</strong>."</p></blockquote> <p>Interesting <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mattwar/archive/2007/10/17/primal-development-methodology.aspx">thoughts</a> from <strong>The Wayward Weblog</strong>.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
