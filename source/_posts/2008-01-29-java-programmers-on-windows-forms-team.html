<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>Randomly: worked with the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.checkedlistbox.aspx">CheckedListBox</a> tonight. It's interesting to run into "getter/setter" type methods in the .NET universe.&nbsp; One would assume a collection that specifically supported setting constituent objects as "selected" or "checked" but instead there are methods like: GetItemCheckedState and SetItemCheckedState.</p> <p>It would be interesting to have the Windows Forms equivalent to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Framework-Standard-Library-Annotated-Reference/dp/0321154894">annotated base class library reference</a>. Perhaps tomorrow I'll try to peak at the source code.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
