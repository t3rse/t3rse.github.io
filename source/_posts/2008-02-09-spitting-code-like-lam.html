<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>I started changing my Visual Studio settings after seeing Hanselman's <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/VisualStudioProgrammerThemesGallery.aspx">post</a> and thought I'd be able to spit fire like John Lam once I'd downloaded <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/06/vibrant_ink_vis.html">his settings</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhHONpmlxPc">it's gotta be</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYc3cZOkwPU&amp;feature=related">the shoes</a>!). The contrast was a bit much (though working in low light helped) and after a night's worth of being like JLam I wanted to go back to (dare I admit?) VS default settings. That didn't work out too well (even using the "default settings" option in VS, go figure) so I opted for <a href="http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/archive/2006/09/07/19030.aspx">Brad Wilson's settings</a> which I've grown to like.</p> <p>When the IDE "hot or not" thing first cropped up I changed settings but what makes me <em>boring</em>, preferring the default, is that I'm on a lot of machines at different times; my laptop, desktop, remote on a couple of servers, and when I help others.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
