<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>Some <a href="http://dormando.livejournal.com/484577.html">good things to repeat to yourself</a> from Dormando. I've a long way to go on so many of these and was geeky enough to give myself a scorecard. </p> <p>I'll spare you that (after just deleting a lot of babble that would only be interesting to me) but there are two areas that I can do with some serious improvement:</p> <p>1. Relentless automation<br>It's shameful how often I'm doing things I could easily automate (repeated FTP sessions?)<br>2. Monitoring<br>I wonder how out of line it would be to programmatically enable "breadcrumbs" for user's activity?&nbsp; Finding out what they really used and what they insisted upon for nothing.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
