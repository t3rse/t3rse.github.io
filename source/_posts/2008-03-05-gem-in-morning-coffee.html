<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>Harry "DevHawk" Pierson <a href="http://devhawk.net/2008/02/27/Morning+Coffee+150.aspx">comments</a> (emphasis mine): </p> <blockquote style="padding-left: 3px; border-left: tomato 1px solid"> <p>My opinion, since you asked Nick, is that EA (Enterprise Architecture) fails to deliver value because it tries to control the uncontrollable. <strong>Trying to gain efficiency thru establishing standards and eliminating overlap via reuse are pipe dreams</strong>, though literally millions of $$$ have been poured into those sink-holes. There are a few areas where centrally funded infrastructure projects can solve big problems that individual projects can't effectively tackle on their own. EA should focus their time there, they can actually make a difference. Otherwise, they should stay out of project's way.</p></blockquote> <p>I concur and there's follow up if you read on in his blog, but this was quite succinct.</p> <p>A funny little aside: I was called for a marketing survey and agreed to it after I found the reward was a $50 coupon for Amazon. The woman caller asked my title and I said "Software Architect" (my given title, though I really fit the mould of a lead developer and plan to have it changed).&nbsp; She paused on "architect" and asked: "But do you write code?"&nbsp; I answered in the affirmative and had to do so to variants of the question (e.g. "But do you implement specifications in code? But do you really know C#?") about 4 or 5 times.&nbsp; Moral of the story, don't use architect in your title, use developer. Unless you're Don Box.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
