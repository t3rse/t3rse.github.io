<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>I go back and forth on the very thing Larry calls "<a href="http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,ac8904ef-2b02-4cea-85f0-c8beef7c5259.aspx#disqus_thread&amp;with_comments=true">Lead-Developer Compression Ratios</a>." Two things happen over the long haul that affect my thinking: first, even though it's time consuming communicating needs to a junior developer, it seems to pay off when it comes to fine tuning and bug fixing - it's not something you have to worry about since it's delegated. "Finished" in my world means it's been through a few cycles of testing, cycles that take a lot of time.&nbsp; The second thing though is when something is delegated and I think is done fairly well only to find at the aforementioned testing/bug fix cycle is horribly broken and either has to be hacked into a <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/content/article.aspx?ArticleID=31611">technical debt</a> ridden working order or needs to be done again - from scratch.&nbsp; It seems to come down to the complexity of the tasks - if it's simple you can take the time, if it's complex just do it yourself.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

hehe - it's so strange how job titles these days have the opposite effects of disambiguity.  <BR/><BR/>Maybe I should borrow Hanselman's "Debugger in Chief" title...</div>

Hee... I call myself a "database engineer"  (since I'm not just a database administrator or a database programmer), but I always wonder if I'm being silly.  Then again, I do have an engineering degree...  "Get me 800 kg of Portland cement, this schema needs reinforcement!"</div>
