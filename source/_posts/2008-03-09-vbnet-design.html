<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>Paul Vick <a href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2008/02/27/22910.aspx">posts</a> on some design considerations for future versions of VB.NET and hits upon something I was complaining about just this week - the fact that one has to speckle their code with line continuation characters in places where they should be implicit.&nbsp; This seems to happen for me in two spots, assigning parameters and string concatenation.&nbsp; </p> <p>It's reassuring that not only does the VB.NET team listen, but they are looking for solutions as well.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
