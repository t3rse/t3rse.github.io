<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>What's the big picture and why are you doing it?</p> <p>A comment from my last post got me thinking I need to get back to the big picture. Robert wrote: </p> <blockquote> <p>Wow. That looks like a hard way to solve your problem. <br>If you absolutely have to mangle Excel data through Python and into a database... can I recommend Resolver?

I spend a lot of time doing quick and dirty types of data import and export.&nbsp; Sometimes it's grabbing stuff off a production system so that I can develop off of it. Other times we get a simple file from someone and we need to pull it into the database.&nbsp; Still other times we move data from one location to the next because we've done staging or cleanup.&nbsp; <p>Traditionally the Microsoft tools for this are quite heavy.&nbsp; DTS, which I used a lot, and SSIS which I haven't used much but have heard and read about are both GUI/IDE approaches towards the problem.&nbsp; SSIS in particular isn't an out of the box solution for a developer like myself who doesn't always install every iota of SQL Server tool there is to install.&nbsp; Usually I can express my problems in a simple sentence:  <p>"Copy the data from this table to that table."<br>"Build an insert script for this table's data"<br>"Import this CSV file to this database" <p>I wondered why language couldn't be used as a tool for this type of work rather than launching a big GUI tool or writing throwaway C# console applications for the job.&nbsp; That's the origin of the thought, cultivated when I heard Neal Ford give a talk at CodeMash on DSLs.&nbsp; A single "sentence" lodged itself in my head and I thought, wow, that would be a nice solution: <p>database("foo").tables("bar").copyto.database("biff") <p>I have to admit to being more of a gardener than an architect when it comes to these things so I started a notepad file with some "forms" I thought would work and one friday afternoon, after being burned out on regular work I started what I call "sketching"; seeing how things might work. Since then I've been gnawing on it in a public way since learning Python and thinking in a Pythonic way are probably even more important than my little module which may end up just being fabulous meware. <p>I had posted that I had a little database import project of about 110,000 records distributed over two excel files.&nbsp; The story I got was exactly the one I envisioned:  <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">cn = "Data Source=.\\sqlexpress;Initial Catalog=MyDB;Integrated Security=SSPI;"<br>colmap = {"Field1":0, "Field2":5, "Field3":7} #destination:source - you may want to use the same source multiple times...<br>database(cn).table("DestinationTable").mapcolumns(colmap).importfrom.csv("C:\\temp\\widgetCo\\update1.csv")<br>database(cn).table("DestinationTable").mapcolumns(colmap).importfrom.csv("C:\\temp\\widgetCo\\update2.csv")</font> <p>I will admit it wasn't perfect the first time - my lazy use of string concatenation rather than the .NET StringBuilder was a huge penalty (~10 minutes). I rewrote those pieces and the whole process took less than 30 seconds. Cheers for ADO.NET on that one - the updates were _massive. <p>So, back to Resolver; I read <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/content/article.aspx?ArticleID=31818">a glowing review</a> from Larry O'Brien (his column is the first thing I read in SD Times when it crosses my desk) and the comment propelled me to watch <a href="http://www.resolversystems.com/screencasts/resolver-one-in-one/">a few</a> <a href="http://www.resolversystems.com/screencasts/web-app-in-10-mins/">screencasts</a> and <a href="http://www.resolversystems.com/documentation/index.php/Writing_to_a_database">dig around</a> but the goal of the product wasn't quite in line with the story I recount above.&nbsp; Perhaps it's possible but it seems more like an interface in which one dwells on providing complex functionality in the spreadsheet rather than just quick and dirty import/export business. <p>More updates forthcoming but a short note: I spent a good part of the weekend trying to read through the code of <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html">ConfigObj 4</a> courtesy of Michael Foord (aka "Fuzzyman" aka "Voidspace").&nbsp; I'll dwell on it further soon but one thing I realized I'd done that was a big mistake is to break the project into lots of files. I put them back together again and am in the process of figuring out how and where to host them. CodePlex/Google Code? Not sure if it's ready for that yet.&nbsp; My own abode <a href="http://www.t3rse.com">t3rse</a> might work but I'd like to figure out how to generate documentation before I do that... <p>Enough said, <a href="http://www.t3rse.com/twining/Twining.py.txt">here is what's latest</a>, details and unit tests tomorrow. <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

"trying to read through the code of ConfigObj 4" - what are you mad! That code wasn't meant to be read. :-)<BR/><BR/>The parser at the heart of ConfigObj is pretty nasty, but the rest of the code should be ok. A lot of the methods are too long though, the code should definitely be more modular.</div>
