<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>Joel's got a big enough voice that I'm sure most people didn't miss his Martian Headphones essay which explained the futility of standards.&nbsp; Jeff Zeldman, who I've always been aware of in my time lurking on the web <a href="http://pixel8.infragistics.com/Default.aspx#Episode:8691">chimes in</a> on web standards on Craig Shoemaker's new gig, "<a href="http://pixel8.infragistics.com/Default.aspx">Pixel 8</a>."&nbsp; The podcast sound is very rough but it's a good context builder for the notion of standards and what they mean.&nbsp; If you've ever had to wrangle with a different look in different browsers, you appreciate standards even if they are complicated and never achieve perfection.</p> <p>Just noticed that Pixel8 has a podcast with Chris Wilson. That will have to wait until tomorrow - </p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
