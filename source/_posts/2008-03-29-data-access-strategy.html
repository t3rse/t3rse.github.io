<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>What data access strategy do you use in your .NET work? The question has been on the mind of Scott Hanselman it seems because the <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=120">last</a> <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=123">few</a> podcasts have covered two different strategies - LINQ and CLSA.&nbsp; Tonight I noticed that <a href="http://adoguy.com/2008/03/21/Data_Access_Strategies.aspx">the ADO guy has a poll</a> of his own with some interesting results: </p> <p><embed src="http://www.micropoll.com/images/fusionchart/Bar2D.swf" width="450" height="300" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" flashvars="debugMode=0&amp;dataURL=http://www.micropoll.com/akira/MicroPollChartData?id=78031" wmode="transparent"></embed></p> <div style="width: 450px" align="right"><a href="http://www.micropoll.com">Web Poll</a> Powered By <a href="http://www.micropoll.com">MicroPoll</a></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I will admit that I'm pretty consistently using ADO.NET + Datasets but more so because the project I'm working on was well under way before the release of VS 2008. I wonder of those responding how many are working on new versus older, longer projects? </p> <p></p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
