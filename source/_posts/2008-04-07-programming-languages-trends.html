<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p><a href="http://www.ddj.com/">DDJ</a> (the print edition at least) has an interesting interview with Paul Jansen, managing director of <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/company/Home.html">TIOBE</a> on languages. Some interesting points:</p> <ul> <li>Direct quote: "I expect in five years time there will be two main languages: Java and C#, followed closely by good old Visual Basic."</li> <li>While not much has changed over the last 10 years, COBOL is now out of the top 10 list and Python is moving in. </li> <li>Direct quote: "Another langauge that has had its day is Perl. It was once the standard language for every system administrator and build manager, but now everyone has been waiting on a new major release for more than seven years. That is considered too long."</li></ul> <p>Interestingly enough, TIOBE has picked <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">the language of the year</a> to be Python. </p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
