<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>I started my IronPython musings with <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm">Notepad++</a> since it's my usual text editor (after being enamored with <a href="http://textpad.com/">Textpad</a> for many years, I moved on - lots of reasons, perhaps I'll blog them later).&nbsp; As time passed and my scripts grew in size I started using an old version of <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/komodo_ide/index.mhtml">Komodo</a> I've got which has decent support for Python. I used Komodo (3.5) when I was writing a lot of Perl and it worked pretty well for that, especially since it had a good enough debugger and CGI emulator for me to dig myself out of holes.&nbsp; Komodo does <em>okay</em> with Python but I've been using <a href="http://www.wingware.com/wingide-personal/index">Wings IDE</a> on recommendation from <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/index.shtml">fuzzyman</a> and it's much more responsive and fluid as a development environment.&nbsp; Additionally, I got Komodo when there was still a cheapo version but now it's quite expensive - exceeding the Wife Acceptance Factor for experiments (WAFe).&nbsp; Wings is quite reasonable, I'll start with the Personal edition and if I can get my company onboard I'll ask that they upgrade my license.</p> <p>Unfortunately I still need to run my scripts outside the IDE environs since Wings isn't built with IronPython support (correct me if I'm wrong), but I'm quite used to this now.&nbsp; </p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

Dude, skimming your blog has made me realize just how behind the times I am.  Once upon a time, ol' Hitchcock was actually tech-savvy.  Now (as I found out last week) a 2005 RPG won't play on my 2007 laptop because my soundcard is incompatible.  I live on MS Word.  Sigh.<BR/><BR/>Being a little homesick - and it being my and Christina's five year anniversary - we ordered from Papa John's last night.  For $30 we got jalapeno and pepperoni pizza, and I was in heaven.  Can't wait to re-contaminate myself with the American diet come August.</div>

Although you do have to run IronPython scripts 'outside' of Wing IDE, it is *very* easy to setup scripts/commands to run your current script (or the test for the current script) and assign them to a function key.</div>
