<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>Some excerpts from <a href="http://ola-bini.blogspot.com/2008/03/meta-level-thinking.html">a great post</a> from Ola Bini, one of the JRuby core developers: </p> <blockquote> <p>In short, I believe that being able to abstract and understand what goes on in a programming language is one way to become more proficient in that language, but not only that - by changing your thinking to see this part of your environment you generally end up programming differently in all languages...</p></blockquote> <p>A little further on, emphasis is mine: </p> <blockquote> <p>... I call this meta-level thinking. I think it's <strong>mostly a learned ability</strong>, but also that there is an aptitude component.</p></blockquote> <p>Cheers for this as a "learned ability" which would give one pretentious enough to call his blog "Metadeveloper" some hope.</p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
