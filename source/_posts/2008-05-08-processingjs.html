<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1> <p>John Resig of jQuery fame has released <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/processingjs/">a library</a> called Processing.js for javascript graphics. Yes, you read that right: Javascript graphics.</p> <p>Earlier this week I was in some training and the instructor asked what future we saw for Silverlight.&nbsp; My response was that I can't drink the koolaid just yet; while there are certainly applications in streaming media in which Silverlight will compete to the death with Flash, for web applications I see people taking Javascript to the level where its maturity with the browser makes most applications feasible. I also like the competitive environment around the Javascript libraries - the Dojo, jQuery, YUI, Scriptaculous, and other people trying to outdo one another just means better ideas, faster turn arounds, and a better experience.&nbsp; </p> <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
