<p></p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>Matt from 37Signals <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1017-workaholics-fixate-on-inconsequential-details">blogs</a> about workaholics with the following assertions: they don't get as much done (most of the time) and they focus on inconsequential details.</p>  <p>Many leapt to the defense of workaholics - people who, it seems, are workaholics themselves. Because I'm often labeled a workaholic I'm trying to see past my emotions and yet it still doesn't smell like the truth to me.</p>  <p>And even more so because this weekend I watched <a href="http://www.pbs.org/nerds/">Triumph of the Nerds</a>, Cringley's chronicling of the personal computer industry from it's humble roots in what would become Silicon Valley.&#160; As he interviewed people, I couldn't help but think that software development is experiencing a culture change.&#160; The people who got the boat off the ground were almost entirely obsessed with their work, even down to the details.&#160; I have a hard time imagining an Andy Hertzfeld, Woz, or young Bill Gates as a 501 developer.</p>  <p>Even if you go forward a few years, guys like John Carmack don't fit the mould of &quot;balanced life/time to go pick up my kids and watch TV!&quot;</p>  <p>These days though, I think what used to be hobbyism is now simply work and fair game for any person who wants a way to earn their keep and &quot;clock out&quot; for life afterwards.&#160; This is not to say that it wasn't that way before, it just seems like much more commitment was involved.&#160; Or maybe the moral is that no one with a 501 development attitude did anything noteworthy. </p>  <p>But even as I write that and play my hand as a kid who grew up on the folklore of the early computer industry I have to do a gut check because me staying at work late building yet another website for someone is not the same as writing the first GUI.&#160; Not even close... </p>  <p>I take away the notion that there isn't necessarily a direct relationship between time spent at work and productivity but I also know that if I had the 9-5 attitude with no tendency to &quot;get into&quot; my profession, I might as well be an accountant. And as grandiose as it may seem, I'd love to have one idea that really matters versus a lifetime of mediocrity so I could rush home to have a &quot;life.&quot;</p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
