<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>I've been having a good time listening to the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow podcasts</a>. Joel's a great curmudgeon and Atwood is as opinionated as ever.&#160; An ongoing disagreement between the two has been the usefulness of knowing C.&#160; Joel's adamant about its importance and Atwood thinks there is much else a developer can spend their time in understanding.&#160; </p>  <p>Eric Sink has since chimed in with a post called <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/c_morse_code.html">C and Morse Code</a> wherein he reveals his cards: like Joel, he thinks it's of vital importance if you want to reach past mediocrity:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I'm not going to take a black-and-white stance on this.&#160; I won't go so far as to say that every developer must learn C.&#160; I've met lots of developers without C experience who are successful and making positive contributions to important software projects.</p>    <p>Furthermore, I'll admit that knowing C is not a magic solution to poor skills.&#160; A lousy developer who happens to know C is simply better equipped to hurt himself or somebody nearby.</p>    <p>However, I can say these two things:</p>    <ol>     <li>All of the truly extraordinary developers I know are people who really understand the kind of low-level details that C forces you to know. </li>      <li>Every programmer without C experience has a clear path of personal development:&#160; Learn C.&#160; Get some real experience using C to write a serious piece of software.&#160; Even if you never use it again, you'll be a better programmer when you're done. </li>   </ol> </blockquote>  <p>My relationship with C is tenuous at best. I spent a few months some years ago delving into it (and C++) seriously - I'm curious to go back and find some of that code but it was a few machines ago*.&#160; I remember during that time I'd work on little toy programs (mostly an implementation of some algorithm) in C and then have the need for a utility and write it in something else.&#160; It would be interesting to take Eric up on his second point of writing a &quot;serious piece of software&quot; using the language.&#160; One interesting angle on this is how one would keep said &quot;serious piece of software&quot; strictly in the realm of C, without venturing too much into the world of C++ and object orientation done poorly.</p>  <p>So brainstorm question: what's something nice and useful that could be implemented strictly within C? (That one might not yawn and think *gosh* that would take 1 minute to do in Python).</p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  <p>   <br />*Great memories of Me, Markus, and <a href="http://www.codegear.com/downloads/free/cppbuilder">bcc32</a> in a coffee house somewhere in southern California.&#160; Too far gone are those days... </p>  </div>
