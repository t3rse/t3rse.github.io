<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>Steve <a href="http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/change-dispenser">posted</a> a coding challenge a few days ago - a change dispenser. I thought it would be a nice exercise for my fledgling Python skills and implemented it with just a small variation on pluralizing coin denominations.     <br />    <br /></p>  <pre style="line-height:120%;padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 12pt; background: #000; padding-bottom: 10px; margin: 1em 0px; overflow: auto; color: #eee; padding-top: 10px; font-family: courier">def make_change(amt):<br />    output = &quot;Change is &quot;<br />    coins = (['quarte|r|rs', 25], ['dim|e|es', 10], ['nicke|l|ls', 5], ['penn|y|ies',1])<br />    for i in coins:   <br />        r = amt // i[1]<br />        if(r &gt; 0):<br />            coinout = re.split('\|', i[0])<br />            output += &quot;%d %s%s &quot; % (r, coinout[0], coinout[1:][r &gt; 1])<br />            amt = amt - (r * i[1])<br />    print output<br />    <br />make_change(48)</pre><br /><br /><p><br />  <br />A few things I learned along the way: <br /><br />  <br />* I was reminded that dictionary objects do not guarantee order. <br /><br />  <br />* I was using Python regular expressions to do a match on the string &quot;this |and|or that&quot; and discovered if you use match with simply \|(\w+) it returns nothing since the match must start from the beginning of the string! <br /><br />  <br />* I was going to use a lambda expression for the pluralization but that's such a large hammer for what in the end would become a split</p><br /><br /><p>Python's behavior with booleans is another point of interest - when I test the following: coinout[1:][r &gt; 1] I'm taking advantage of anything true being a 1. I wonder if this is &quot;bad&quot; but it's a seductive thing to take advantage of... </p><br /><br /><h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
