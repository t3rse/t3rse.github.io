<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>As my reading of <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Minima">Minima source code</a> continues I wanted next to comment upon the database interaction which is novel (to me at least) in that it is exclusively a LINQ implementation with no stored procedure or ADO.NET implementation.&#160; I've seen LINQ quite a bit, but many using it seem to stick to using the query syntax rather than using raw lambda expressions.&#160; All the LINQ in Minima that I've seen uses lambda expressions and I've&#160; come to appreciate it as a clean, sparse syntax.&#160; To illustrate a more trivial example, assuming I have a table Users with Username / Password columns I wanted to verify for access. The first step with all things LINQ is to make your data model, which amounts to a DBML file that you map database objects to with drag and drop. Next you can write query expressions to pull data out of the database - notice that the db variable here points to the data model as embodied in a &quot;data context&quot; object: </p>  <pre style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 12pt; background: #000; padding-bottom: 10px; margin: 1em 0px; overflow: auto; color: #eee; line-height: 120%; padding-top: 10px; font-family: courier">            var authUserQuery = from u in db.Users <br />                    where u.Email == Login1.UserName &amp;&amp; u.Passphrase == Login1.Password<br />                        select u;</pre><br /><br /><p>Unfortunately the query expressions return an IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; that doesn't support a Count or Length property. It's a somewhat inflexible thing that in my *very* limited experience is useful mainly for iterating with a ForEach - and I suspect it's reasons like this that led Betz to using a lambda syntax that is much cleaner and gets more bang with less code: </p><br /><br /><pre style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 12pt; background: #000; padding-bottom: 10px; margin: 1em 0px; overflow: auto; color: #eee; line-height: 120%; padding-top: 10px; font-family: courier">            Func&lt;Data.User, Boolean&gt; checkUser = x =&gt; x.Email == Login1.UserName &amp;&amp; x.Passphrase = Login1.Password;<br />            Data.User u = db.Users.SingleOrDefault(checkUser);</pre><br /><br /><p>You can use nullability to test for the presence of a record based on the LINQ query. Some source from Minima that demonstrates this is verification of the existence of a blog author: </p><br /><br /><pre style="padding-right: 10px; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 12pt; background: #000; padding-bottom: 10px; margin: 1em 0px; overflow: auto; color: #eee; line-height: 120%; padding-top: 10px; font-family: courier">            Func&lt;AuthorLINQ, Boolean&gt; authorExists = x =&gt; x.AuthorEmail == authorEmail;<br />            authorLinq = db.Authors.SingleOrDefault(authorExists);<br />            if (authorLinq == null)<br />            {<br />                throw new ArgumentException(message);<br />            }</pre><br /><br /><p>It's truly novel and I don't mean to make that sound like a trivial or ornamental type &quot;novel&quot; I write; after spending so much time building a data access layer with stored procedures and ADO.NET (Connection, Command, Reader, DataSet, ad nauseum) it seems like our collective destiny is to walk away from that and let something like a DBML data context do black magic for us.</p><br /><br /><p>Even though the ADO.NET Entity Framework is getting a <a href="http://efvote.wufoo.com/forms/ado-net-entity-framework-vote-of-no-confidence/">FAIL</a> vote from some people, I'm interested to see how this overlaps with LINQ. Even after listening to Hanselman's <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=120">interview</a> of Mike Pizzo I'm still a little unclear. My plan of action is to get serious about NHibernate to try to understand, as Scott would say, &quot;the gestalt&quot; of an ORM and then make the call on ADO.NET Entity Framework when it's released.</p><br /><br /><h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
