Good article but I'm not sure the thinking is complete (I'd have to think about it!).  There's a big hole, MLB-quality pitchers are mentioned therefore the first baseline graph isn't appropriate.  <BR/>Regarding your musing about whether it applies to programmers, don't forget the curve depends alot on whether they're being "pitched" by MLB-quality problems!<BR/>(There are plenty of good coders whose .401 average is because they're fiddling with less than intricate business processes).</div>
