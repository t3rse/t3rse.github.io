<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>Got <a href="http://lbrandy.com/blog/2008/10/how-we-made-our-face-recognizer-25-times-faster/">this</a> a few weeks ago from a friend but didn't have a chance to sit down and digest the entry until tonight. Pretty cool and although premature optimization gets a bad rap, it's a reminder that sometimes what seems intuitive and quick could actually be costing a lot - </p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

Unsure when I linked to that article before (perhaps from you?), the methodology is fascinating even though I don't understand the code.  Didn't read the Comments on that one until just now.  Isn't it interesting how a discussion about how to deal with an challenge can get derailed by a discussion of whether we should participate at all?   Lead me to ponder ... "Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's'".  -ERD</div>
