<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>Kevin Dangoor recorded an interesting screencast on some of the essentials of getting an open source project more widely circulated. Essentially Dangoor explains that having a successful open source project is not just about code, it's about good product management. I wanted to title this post with Dangoor's most quotable quote: &quot;Rails is not where it is because of great code.&quot; But there are a lot of people who would take that as an opener for a religious war without seeing his real intent of highlighting marketing and management of a project.</p>  <p>I won't rehash it, it's worth <a href="http://dangoor.blip.tv/file/1530233/">watching it</a> for yourself.</p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
