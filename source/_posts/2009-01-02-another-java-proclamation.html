<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>I was browsing to Elliote Rusty Harold's blog to see if he had any predictions for XML in 2009 and to my surprise I found his post: &quot;<a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/programming/java-is-dead-long-live-python/">Java is Dead. Long Live Python!</a>&quot;</p>  <p>My familiarity with Harold comes from a time in my life where I worked heavily with XML and later Java and it was <a href="http://www.elharo.com/">his books</a> on both subjects that proved invaluable when I hit my rather frequent roadblocks.&#160; As invested as he is in Java, what would make him say as much? In a nutshell, it's the way the language has been implemented over the last few years - claims which, even if you don't agree with the premise that Java is &quot;dead like COBOL&quot;, are worth some attention.</p>  <p>What is interesting to me about Java right now is not the language itself but dynamic languages and their platforms built on top of the JVM. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JRuby">JRuby</a> is what comes to mind first and I'm recently interested in what a <a href="http://wiki.glassfish.java.net/Wiki.jsp?page=JRuby">JRuby/Glassfish</a> world looks and feels like. </p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
