<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>A simple step by step<sup>1</sup>.</p>  <p>1. Download the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/sdlsdk/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=11955">Silverlight DLR SDK</a></p>  <p>2. Map the binaries (the folder with Chiron<sup>2</sup> et. al.)&#160; in your PATH Environment variable.     <br />    <br /><img src="http://seruyange.com/metadeveloper/ChironPath.jpg" /> </p>  <p>3. Download <a href="http://seruyange.com/metadeveloper/Starter.zip">this starter template</a>.</p>  <p>4. Run <font face="Courier New"><strong>chiron /w</strong></font> from the command line in the directory of the starter.     <br />    <br /><img src="http://seruyange.com/metadeveloper/ChironInit.jpg" />     <br />    <br /><em>a) Make sure you're in the correct folder      <br />b) The command is</em><font face="Courier New"><em> </em><strong><em>chiron /w          <br /></em></strong></font><em>c) You'll get a message that Chiron is serving at </em><a href="http://localhost:2060"><em></em><a href="http://localhost:2060a">http://localhost:2060</a></a>a</a></p>  <p>5. Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:2060">http://localhost:2060</a> and hit index.html to see what's up.</p>  <p><img src="http://seruyange.com/metadeveloper/ChironRunning.jpg" />     <br />    <br /><img src="http://seruyange.com/metadeveloper/StarterPyLight.jpg" />&#160; <br />The starter<sup>3</sup> should make it easy to get up and running. Open the <em>app.py</em> and <em>app.xaml</em> files and you will be able to modify the xaml and write code to customize it into your own creation.</p>  <p>1. Michael Foord aka Voidspace is <strong>the guy</strong> when it comes to IronPython. He wrote a book on it. He has <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/silverlight/introduction.shtml">a &quot;getting started&quot; tutorial that is much more extensive</a> if you want more details. His tutorial isn't as terse so I thought I'd write this one for people who just want a step by step before poking around. There are other people like <a href="http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/">JimmyThinking</a> who offer a lot of help to beginners but lean towards IronRuby.</p>  <p>2. The name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiron">Chiron</a> for a tool makes me think about a few things: first, being born out of time since most BigCo shops today name computers and tools in a hollow, mechanistic fashion. In the salad days of computing on Unix, tools had cool names like ed or yacc. The second thing I think is that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dmitryr/default.aspx">Dmitri</a> (and I'm sure there's an &quot;et. al.&quot;) must be a cool, interdisciplinary fellow to come up with a name like that.</p>  <p>3. The exchange in the sample is from Swahili classes at <a href="http://www.rusinga.ac.ke/">Rusinga Primary School</a> in Nairobi.</p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>

When you said "in 5 steps" I was hoping for interpretive dance.  C'est la vie.</div>
