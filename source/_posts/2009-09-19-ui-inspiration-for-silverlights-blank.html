<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>I’ll admit that I spent an inordinate amount of time last week thinking about dialog boxes. Silvelright’s canned prompt comes courtesy of a call to MessageBox.Show which displays the browser’s native modal dialog. I think you get the same thing from HtmlPage.Window.Alert too. Needless to say, these <em>should</em> leave you wanting.</p>  <p>A good place to start, rather than wasting the better part of a day playing around like me, is to begin with a really good convention rather than making something “original.” </p>  <p>So without further ado, I’m linking to <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/?p=1628">a nice PSD</a> courtesy of <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com">teehan+lax</a> that contains visual styles for many of the iPhone’s UI Elements. I’ll have to build a nice workflow to get things like this into XAML.     <br /></p>  <div style="width: 100%; border-top: black 1px dotted">&#160;</div>  <p>One more philosophical note (noted below so that if you just needed the link you won’t be daunted by my long windedness) – almost 100 episodes ago the <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes podcast</a> featured Scott interviewing <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> and <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/">Martin Fowler</a> at RailsConf 2007. When talking about UI design and originality here is what DHH had to say: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>“I think the low level of      <br />expressiveness that we have in HTML and CSS       <br />and JavaScript is actually a huge boon to most       <br />applications that constraints are a good thing,       <br />that<strong> constraints leads to better applications when        <br />we don’t need to reinvent everything</strong>. When you       <br />just have blank canvas where you can paint       <br />whatever you want on it, you pretty much end up       <br />with something “original” every time; and I don’t       <br />think originality in UI design is necessarily a good       <br />thing; I just think actually most of the time it's a       <br />bad thing.”</p> </blockquote>  <p>I agree with DHH on this point. It’s worth listening to the entire podcast to put some context to his comments. Where my opinion veers from his or at least my hope for Silverlight is that conventions more powerful than those of HTML/CSS/JavaScript begin to come together for developers and they spend less time thinking about a blank slate and more about how their application works with the benefit of a better experience. <a href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Silverlight%20Toolkit%20Overview%20Part%203">Themes</a> are a good step in this direction but things like dialogs go beyond to interactions as opposed to just colors and gradients.</p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
