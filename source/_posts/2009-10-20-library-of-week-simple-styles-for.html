<h1><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h1>  <p>I’ll admit I have a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Man%20Crush">Man Crush</a> on Robbie Ingebretsen that began when I discovered his work at MIX earlier this year. To expound a bit: Microsoft has worked hard to try to draw a line in the sand between “developer” and “designer” – a line I always had a visceral dislike for because it’s always been people like Robbie Ingebretsen who I’ve always tried to pattern myself after: people who can write code AND produce beautiful designs. </p>  <p>One of the more difficult things I’ve encountered in Silverlight is dealing with control templates. Even something as simple as a button, when opened in Blend, involves quite a few different moving parts so that changing behavior doesn’t always produce a desired effect. For example: changing the background of the button at some given visual state will not affect the button unless you take into account a predefined background gradient that is a part of it. </p>  <p>The <a href="http://blog.nerdplusart.com/archives/silverlightsimplestyles">Simple Styles samples</a> are stripped down, intuitive versions of the control templates with a concise starting point for anyone working to customize their behavior. To go back to the previous example, changing the background of a button involves changing the BackgroundElement. Rather than changing individual gradient stops in a Visual State, simple modify the entire element related to that Visual State. </p>  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="400"><tbody>     <tr>       <td valign="top" width="200">Default Button Template</td>        <td valign="top" width="200">Simple Button</td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="200"><img src="http://www.t3rse.com/metadeveloper/SilverlightButtonStyle.jpg" /> </td>        <td valign="top" width="200"><img src="http://www.t3rse.com/metadeveloper/SimpleButtonStyle.jpg" /> </td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="200">102 lines of XAML</td>        <td valign="top" width="200">38 lines of XAML</td>     </tr>   </tbody></table>  <p>The button is a starting point for simple conversations but there are controls like the listbox which can be deceptively unwieldy in how they are managed1.</p>  <p>The structure of the Simple Styles is also beautiful – not simply a resource dictionary with everything crammed together but a separate file for each control, a gesture one would think was straightforward until you see the many <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/corrinab/archive/2008/10/01/8971166.aspx">examples</a> of Silverlight styles coming from Blend generated files.&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>I <a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2009/09/ui-inspiration-for-silverlights-blank.html">mentioned previously</a> that I think that the antidote to the “blank slate” of RIA is good precedent and patterns developers and designers turn to when they build things. I think Simple Styles are a step in that direction; what I wouldn’t give to look through Robbie’s resource dictionaries. How about it Robbie?</p>  <h1><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h1>  </div>
