<h2>{</h2>  <p>Since my days <strong><em><a href="http://metadeveloper.blogspot.com/2007/02/language-and-thinking.html">trying to hack up some Perl</a></em></strong><sup>1</sup> I was charmed by the idea of a developer’s advent calendar: a day by day lead up to Christmas with articles pertaining to a specific topic. I’m otherwise a scrooge during the holiday time; not given to commercialism, Christmas music, and other seasonal rituals. </p>  <p>But I am up for the both the <a href="http://perladvent.pm.org/2010/">Perl Advent Calendar</a> and the <a href="http://advent.rjbs.manxome.org/2010/">RJBS (Perl) Advent Calendar</a>. On a similar vein, <a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/">Sys Advent</a>, a sys admin advent calendar should be interesting tracking too.</p>  <p>Others have riffed on the idea, most notably web developers. <a href="http://24ways.org/2010">24ways</a> is a seasonal advent project that I’ve tuned into each year – I usually have at least one or two of the posts stick. </p>  <p>Finally, there is an entrepreneurial advent calendar, <a href="http://24waystostart.com/2010/">24waystostart</a>. A lot of good things in there, I feel the onset of holiday good cheer. </p>  <p>I’m disappointed not to find a .NET Advent calendar (or even a Python one!). If you know of a good advent calendar, developer or otherwise, feel free to share. A few good articles can make the season pleasurable, even for a grinch like me. </p>  <h2>}</h2>  <p><sup>1</sup>Could it have been that long ago? Funny to see those old posts, but that's part of why I blog</p>  </div>
