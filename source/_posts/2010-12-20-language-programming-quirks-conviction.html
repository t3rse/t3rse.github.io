Blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between the streets.”</p>    <p>He looks a little disappointed and leaves.</p>    <p>… </p>    <p>So now imagine that you are standing in Tokyo one day and you’re a little lost and you turn to somebody next to you and you say “Excuse me, what is the name of this street?”</p>    <p>And they say, “That is block 17 and that is block 16.”</p>    <p>And you say “Yeah, but what is the name of this street?”</p>    <p>And they say, “Streets don’t have names; that’s just the space between blocks 16 and 17.”</p>    <p><font size="6">”</font></p> </blockquote>  <p>A great talk from <a href="http://sivers.org/blog">Derek Sivers</a> given at RailsConf earlier this year <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4565.html">available on IT Conversations</a>.</p>  <h3><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h3>  </div>
