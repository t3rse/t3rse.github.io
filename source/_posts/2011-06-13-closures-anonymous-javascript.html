<h2><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h2>  <p>I’ve taken knocks in the past because of my penchant for closures and lambdas. Syntactically they never looked that strange to me and most of the time when I used them it was because it made more sense to get a sense of the flow of how things were assigned. I thought: this feels so natural, what makes it so different from some of the people I’m around using C#? Here’s an example of how I’d approach something: in the constructor, assign a loading handler, in that handler, assign a click handler, and rather than putting it in some separate method where I’d have to scroll or look elsewhere, just place it here: </p>  <pre class="brush:csharp">        public MainPage()<br />        {<br />            InitializeComponent();<br /><br />            this.Loaded += (o, e) =&gt; <br />            {<br />                myButton.Click += (_, e2) =&gt;<br />                {<br />                    myText.Text = &quot;Hello World&quot;;<br />                };<br />            };<br />        }</pre><br /><br /><p>But then the other day I was tinkering with KnockoutJS, writing some Javascript with jquery and it dawned on my why I approach things the way I do. </p><br /><br /><pre class="brush:js">        $(document).ready(function () {<br />            $('#myButton').click(function () {<br />                $('#myLabel').text('Hello World');<br />            });<br />        });</pre><br /><br /><p>It's always interesting to make that connection more formally than trying to explain why my approach would be “better.” The advantage of being able to use a closure with the above approach has always been the main rational I’ve given when forced to come up with an answer. </p><br /><br /><h2><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h2>  </div>
