<h2><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h2>  <blockquote>   <p style="line-height: 160%; font-size: 3em">“More features isn’t [sic] better. More features is unfocused. More features means you’ll do them worse. More features means you probably don’t have any differentiation. If you’re doing a startup, you should have <em>less </em>[sic] features than your competitors. If you have more features, you’re probably doing it wrong.”</p> </blockquote>  <p>Nugget from <a href="http://poorbuthappy.com/ease/archives/2011/06/12/4875/more-features-competitive-advantage-for-a-startup">Peter Van Dijck</a>. So the question is: when do you add a new feature? Joel Spolsky (who has written about most interesting things already, way back in the day (although it would be interesting to hear if things are still done the same in the present day FogCreek) ) <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/SetYourPriorities.html">wrote</a> about how they decided on new features by prioritizing and voting as a group. </p>  <p>As <a href="http://www.t3rse.com">a developer of one</a> I’m interested in techniques on deciding what to put on a roadmap and how to prioritize features. Any insight? </p>  <h2><font color="#0000ff">}</font></h2>  </div>
