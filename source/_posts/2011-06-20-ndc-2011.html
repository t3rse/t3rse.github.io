<h2><font color="#0000ff">{</font></h2>  <p>It may be easy to miss amidst all the hoopla around Windows 8 but the Norwegian Developers Conference just released all their session vidoes on the site. </p>  <p>It’s been a while since I’ve gotten to go to a conference but the last few I have attended were put on by Microsoft. Although this has advantages in the sense that it coalesces the “experts” of specific Microsoft technologies, many of the presenters work at Microsoft and therefore don’t have a similar problem set that you or I might slogging our way through building products, often with older (read: more “boring”) software. There are also some talks on development techniques like <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/">BDD</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">DDD</a> that are not product specific.</p>  <p>The good thing about NDC is that it seems a lot of the presenters come from an outside perspective so it’s a good balance for a lot of the MIX / PDC type stuff I’ve been watching of late.
