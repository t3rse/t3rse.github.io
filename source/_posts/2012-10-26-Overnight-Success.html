<p>There was a time in my life when I daydreamed about being at a startup, eating pizza, and writing code while I worked the kind of hours that would be daunting for a Foxconn factory worker. Although this period of my life predates the <a href="http://paulgraham.com/" target="_blank">Paul Graham</a> / <a href="http://ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">YCombinator</a> era (it all started with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0887308554/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0887308554&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=t3rse-20">Accidental Empires</a><img style="border-bottom-style: none !important; margin: 0px; border-left-style: none !important; border-top-style: none !important; border-right-style: none !important" border="0" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=t3rse-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0887308554" width="1" height="1" /> ), PG and the YCombinator stories are a part of internet lore much in the same way that <a href="http://www.folklore.org/index.py" target="_blank">the stories of Apple</a> captured an earlier generation’s imagination. </p>  <p>Although my life as a husband and father shifts my values and perspectives on the concepts of startups (very cool for other people but the time isn’t right for me), I still like the yarns of what it takes to have an idea and build a company out of it. This was why I tuned in to the Startup School broadcast. </p>  <p>One presentation that stuck with me was <a href="http://david.weebly.com/index.html" target="_blank">David Rusenko</a> of <a href="http://www.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Weebly</a>, a company built around serving people who want an easy, low impact way of building a website. The end of the story is where Weebly is now: vastly successful in terms of revenue, profitability, and pervasiveness – some 2% of active websites on the internet run on their platform. Weebly and his crew lived the dream: a small idea in college with friends, getting funded by YCombinator, living in San Francisco and making it big. They’ve been featured in <em>TechCrunch</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, and&#160; <em>Newsweek</em>, and elsewhere. It’s enough to make the entrepreneurially challenged among us say “that’s so awesome” and miss out on the focal point of Rusenko’s talk - the timeline: </p>  <p>February 2006 – start of coding</p>  <p>August 2006 - 12 new users / friends and family</p>  <p>October 2006 - 30 new users / signups</p>  <p>November 2006 – Getting Techcrunched, a quick spike in user signups</p>  <p>January 2007 - at 11 months, move to san franscisco, less than 100 signups / day, only $100 in bank account</p>  <p>May 2007 - featured in newsweek (15 months in)</p>  <p>August 2007 - featured in Time, 50 best websites, (18 months in), but no “hockey stick” growth</p>  <p>October 2007 - rate of new users signups per day inflection point to positive territory</p>  <p>Fall 2008 – Economic meltdown, tough economy, bank balance going toward 0. </p>  <p>December 2008 - Figuring out what bills to pay, more financial trouble</p>  <p>January 2009 - BREAK EVEN (35 months after starting)</p>  <p>…and now, encouraging the rest of us who aspire that <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000017.html" target="_blank">good software takes a long time to build</a>. </p>  <p><strong>Part 1:</strong></p> <iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/l_b228qEVi8" frameborder="0" width="420" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Part 2: </strong></p> <iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/F90BRJHXsVI" frameborder="0" width="420" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
