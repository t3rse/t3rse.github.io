<p>Many moons ago, when I was growing up on the potholed streets of Nairobi, I discovered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_mullen" target="_blank">Rodney Mullen</a> through a friend who was a skater. My friend had a quarter pipe and lots of issues of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrasher_(magazine)" target="_blank">Thrasher</a></em> magazine he’d either bring back or have sent to him from Canada. We watched skate videos at his house whenever I was over. I even talked him into giving me a few skateboarder t-shirts. In a nutshell I was, in every way, a skater despite the fact that I couldn’t skate. </p>  <p>Now, so many years down the road I realize this wasn’t a dumb stretch of my imagination. As Rodney Mullen explains in his TED talk, skateboarding is just a different type of hacking. </p>  <p><iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gwjlDBjNzXk" frameborder="0" width="560" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>  <blockquote style="line-height: 180%; font-size: 1.6em">There is an intrinsic value in creating something for the sake of creating it. </blockquote>  <p>Not from this talk but there is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cgJ0glrzw0" target="_blank">another Rodney Mullen quote</a> I've made into a personal mantra: </p>  <blockquote style="line-height: 180%; font-size: 1.6em">Fall in love with the simple motions of what you do</blockquote>
