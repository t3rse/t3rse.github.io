<p>Today while digging up an old podcast of a talk by Clayton Christensen I discovered IT Conversations will be no more as of year’s end. Doug Kaye <a href="http://www.blogarithms.com/index.php/archives/2012/09/16/cn-mission-accomplished/" target="_blank">writes</a>: </p>  <blockquote>   <p style="line-height: 180%">We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished. Much of what we’ve pioneered in the past ten years is now commonplace. Our goal was to make it easy for others to produce audio recordings of events and make them available to the world for free. That’s now the norm. We have succeeded.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Indeed they have succeeded. I wanted to just post a small homage to what IT Conversations meant to me and point to a few of my favorite talks given over the last decade. These were easy for me to find since I used to download and archive podcasts just in case. The good news, however, is that the content is going to The Internet Archive and should be there for the foreseeable future. </p>  <p>IT Conversations always represented the ability for me to reach out and connect to the better and brightest minds out there who were thinking about innovation and technology. This became all the more valuable after I relocated to South Dakota where I didn’t have a network of geek friends to feed off of and find inspiration. Even now, amongst the noises of the internet and information tsunami of social media, I can easily displace that sort of lonely feeling of working in isolation by finding a good podcast and making a virtual friendship. Even though their work is considered done I’ll still return to old favorites and enjoy the tell. With that said, here are just a few of the memorable talks over the years for me: </p>  <p><font size="4">Clayton Christensen: </font><a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail135.html#" target="_blank"><font size="4">Capturing the Upside</font></a><font size="4"> – March 17, 2004</font></p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_M._Christensen" target="_blank">Clayton Christensen</a> is a professor at the Harvard Business School.

The reason? His collaboration with <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/" target="_blank">Jeff Atwood</a> on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> and the <a href="http://stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">StackExchange</a> network of sites has revolutionized what it means to be a programmer in the internet age. Perhaps the same can be said for many other professions from <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/?as=1" target="_blank">mathematics</a> to <a href="http://history.stackexchange.com/?as=1" target="_blank">historians</a>. In this talk you get the full Joel: humor, intelligence, and wisdom.
