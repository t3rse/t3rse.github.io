title: "Your Age In Developer Years: A Proposal"
comments: true

<p>At the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfdevs/" target="_blank">local developer meetup</a> someone was jokingly talking about “developer years” as an analog to “dog years.” It is kind of fun to think about – I didn’t get started until I had already finished school but there are a lot of people who already have years under their belts by the time they finish high school. </p>  <p>I probably toyed with the idea longer than it’s usefulness but came up with the following methodology for determining developer years: “How many data access frameworks from Microsoft have you lived through?” My start was in the waning years of DAO and RDO, just before they were replaced by ADO. I am not sure if anyone has a full list of data access APIs from then until now but my guess is that I am 8: </p>  <ol>   <li>DAO / RDO</li>    <li>MDAC 1.x</li>    <li>MDAC 2.x</li>    <li>ADO.NET</li>    <li>Linq to Sql</li>    <li>EF* </li>    <li>EF 4*</li>    <li>EF 5*</li> </ol>  <p>I am not counting minor releases (there were 9 for MDAC 2.x as an example). I also placed an asterisk by technologies I have never used in a production environment.</p>  <p>I wonder what other ways can you measure your developer years? How many times must we solve the age old problem of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" target="_blank">CRUD</a> with a database? Or generating HTML for web pages?</p>
