I visited New York for the first time when I was still based in a Southern California exurb. It was overwhelming, beginning with the clear memory of a man yelling at me to get out of his way upon exiting an elevator. I'd been to many cities but New York is a singular experience: dense, difficult, and beautiful.  

My new Mac was beautiful. After years on stodgy looking PCs, the contours and heft of the hardware were a revelation. 

The exurbs I'd gotten used to are comfortable places. You must have a car to get around but it's easy to find places you like to eat and hang out. The people are relaxed. You can still get to the proper "city" but only after working up the motivation to deal with traffic and drive for 30 minutes. I did it all the time but relegated it to night time, when working hours were over.
