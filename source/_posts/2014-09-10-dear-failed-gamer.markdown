Dear Failed Gamer, 

Don't be so hard on yourself. You're getting on in life, maybe not like the about to die sense but more in the way of a professional athlete who has realized though their mind is willing, their body has decided otherwise. The game has been good to you and the failures of the present have to do with circumstance and time.

Instead, failed gamer, recall with happiness the first encounter with the NES - one which made it's way from a Texas suburb into your Nairobi living room. The kid who owned it didn't have a television so you got to keep it and along with it, a single game treasure trove: Mario. 

Reach back into your memories of high school: coin op machines at the mall, endless battles in Street Fighter II, the kids whose first names and fighting styles you knew without any prejudgement on their school or economic background. He chose Ryu, you chose Ken. He chose Blanka, you chose Guile. 

Remember the dank arcade of your college years, the waning moments of that industry, as consoles gained momentum even though you preferred standing next to your competition as you obliterated them. In the low light as the evenings waned, you would pound away at the machine until a petite and wild eyed kid, Willie, would make his entrance. Everyone knew to play against Willie was to experience the most merciless and beautiful beat down a video game fighting avatar could give. Even if the beatdown was your predestiny, it was how you learned, got better and sought the perfection of the Willie beat down when lesser gamers challenged you.
