## t3rse is David Seruyange. 

I am a software developer based in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I arrived here via Southern California and before that, East Africa. I have spent more than a decade working at my craft in all kinds of environments: publicly traded companies, small businesses, and startups amongst others. 

My approach to work is inspired by 3 things<sup>1</sup> I believe must exist in good software: 

#### Commodity 
> To serve some given purpose

##### Firmament 
> Durability under use

##### Delight 
> Aesthetic and functional beauty

I have always been interested in many things. As a programmer I like syntactical constructs and language. As an aesthete I am an architecture and design enthusiast. Both my background and education give me a penchant for literature, economics, history, and public policy. As a thinker I can't evade brushes with the philosophical.

## Why Fail Better?

The quote that subtitles this blog comes from [Samuel Beckett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett). Although it might be an out of context meme it represents, for me, the ideal of the man in the arena, eloquently put by Teddy Roosevelt: 

> **It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.**

<sup>1</sup>This idea was originally purposed for architecture by [Vitrivius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius).
